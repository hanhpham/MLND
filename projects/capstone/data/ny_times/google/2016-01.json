A classic \"New Yorker,\" in every sense of the word, Christina was a native of the Upper West Side for over 50 years. She was an avid Riverside Park gardener, a frequent face at Fairway, and knew every sidewalk crack and crevasse of the Upper West Side. The daughter of Vera Federoff, of Ryazan, Russia, and Bertrand J. Laney, of New York City, Christina was born in Hankow, China, on December 28, 1932, her family fleeing China in 1940, shortly after the Japanese offensive. A true explorer, Christina traveled the world with her family, attending schools in China, Panama, El Salvador, and finally, at the University of Texas, and at New York University. It was in 1953, that Christina, in her own words, \"found her Nirvana\"-New York City. For over 30 years, she was involved in the entertainment industry, acting in small movie and television roles, then working behind the scenes in public relations, advertising, and film production. At United Artists, Christina was the Assistant to the Director of Special Projects for six years. She also worked for the Writer's Guild. Christina was a Vice President of Women of the Motion Picture Industry, and won their Dottie Reeves Humanitarian Award for Community Service. Christina's hobbies were manifold. Her diminutive size and powerhouse personality made her a natural spelunker. She was a member of the National Speleological Society for many years. A talented artist and poet in her own right, Christina supported Women in Motion Pictures, and the Curtain Club. She championed dozens of causes including: The Humane Society, The New York Historical Society, Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society, World Wildlife Fund, The Nature Conservancy, and the ASPCA. Christina was a lifelong volunteer for groups such as Channel 13, The Girl Scout Council of Greater New York, and, for 50 years, the Riverside Park Conservancy, where she was honored for her volunteer contribution in her beloved garden on 78th Street and Riverside Drive. Before there was Google, there was Christina. A voracious reader and a fount of knowledge about a myriad of subjects, especially New York City, family and friends could always rely on Christina for an irrefutable answer. Into her 80s, Christina was a brilliant, plucky, feisty spitfire who continued to stimulate her mind by regular attendance at jazz concerts, museums, art galleries, and theater. She was a devoted sister, aunt, cousin, and friend-a tiny woman with a huge spirit, who will be deeply missed. Christina is survived by her older sister, Kera Toline Rogers of Charleston, SC; niece Catherine Anna Toline, husband Leo Lentsch; nephews, John Colin Toline, and son John, Mark Anderson Toline, wife Ann, and son North, and Paul Alexander Toline; and cousins, Barbara Laney Swenson of Hanover, New Hampshire, Ainslie Drummond of Florida, and Irene Morgan Kay of Australia. Christina's ashes will be interred in Moline, Illinois, with her parents and Russian grandmother, Barbara (Babi) Federoff. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in memory of Christina B. Laney to: Riverside Park Conservancy, 475 Riverside Drive, Suite 455, New York, NY 10115. 1/3", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  LANEY, CHRISTINA B"}, "pub_date": "2016-01-31T00:00:00Z", "abstract": null, "print_page": "25", "word_count": "523", "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE1D71F3AF932A05752C0A9609D8B63", "multimedia": [], "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "LANEY, CHRISTINA B"}], "subsection_name": null, "_id": "56b8141938f0d87ed55e9749", "byline": null, "section_name": "Paid Death Notices"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "snippet": "Odds are good that when you search Google for someone to help you get into your home or car, results will include poorly trained subcontractors who will squeeze you for cash....", "news_desk": "SundayBusiness", "lead_paragraph": "Odds are good that when you search Google for someone to help you get into your home or car, results will include poorly trained subcontractors who will squeeze you for cash.", "headline": {"main": "Fake Online Locksmiths May Be Out to Pick Your Pocket, Too", "print_headline": "When Locksmiths Pick Pockets"}, "pub_date": "2016-01-31T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "Locksmiths complain that so-called 'lead generators' are using high-tech strategies to fool Google into listing them in search results as local services; customers, attracted by low prices, are tricked into contacting call centers that dispatch poorly trained subcontractors who often demand far more than listed rate; operations are often based in other countries; much of blame is centered on Google, which makes money from process through its AdWords advertising platform.
