He is co-author, with Chris Trimble, of ''10 Rules for Strategic Innovators: From Idea to Execution,'' (Harvard Business School Press, 2005, $29.95). Here are excerpts from a conversation: Q. Why is the subject of innovation so hot these days? A. In the 1990's, people were just rolling the dice and spending billions of dollars. It was reckless innovation. Post-9/11 and the dot-com bursting, people went back to cost-cutting. But now they also said, ''After Act I is over, we must create growth and innovation.'' This time, they're saying, ''We want to grow, but minimize risks and grow profitably.'' Innovation has come back with a different twist. It's very much on the agenda of chief executive officers. Without growth and innovation, organizations die. Q. Is this fascination with innovation being driven by the emergence of new competitors from China and India? A. The emergence of India and China has made innovation extremely critical. Together they are about $2 trillion in gross domestic product. That's only 5 percent of the world's G.D.P. But if these two economies grow at the rate at which the World Bank and Goldman Sachs predict, then tens of trillions of dollars worth of economic activity will be created in the next 25 years. Q. Are larger companies a more important source of American innovation than smaller ones? A. I would not say it is ''either'' or ''or.'' We need small start-ups to continue the innovation stream. But I believe that only large companies like General Electric can solve big, complex problems, which can make a huge difference to humanity. Q. Which are the most innovative large companies today? A. There is no perfect example. G.E., eBay, Johnson & Johnson and 3M come to mind. This is a topic that almost every company is concerned about. When you are a large, established, tradition-bound company, to fundamentally innovate, it's not in your genes. Fundamental innovation implies that you have to selectively forget some of the things you're doing well today. That's not so easy. Q. You say that Apple is among the best innovators in the technology world. Which other companies belong on that list? A. Motorola. They stumbled in the 90's and missed the boat on several things. But in the past three or four years, it has regained its dominant position. A third company is Google. Some people said it was just a fad and would disappear. But they have created a whole new space and continue to change the rules of the game. Q. The largest 500 companies in the country have been net shedders of jobs. Shouldn't they be considered consolidators, not innovators? A. Yes and no. It is true that if you look at Fortune 500 companies, many of them have focused on cost-cutting, re-engineering and restructuring, all of which means shedding jobs. It will be a real shame if companies go bankrupt because they just simply shed jobs. The question is, how do we stop it? They have a lot of capabilities. We as a country must help these companies to maintain an innovative spirit. Q. Say I'm the chief executive of a major company. Is there a secret to achieving innovation in my company? A. First, strategic innovation is critical for you. Don't ignore it. In addition to continuous process improvement, focus on strategic innovation. Secondly, coming up with a new idea is only the starting point. You need to pay attention to execution of the idea. Q. What else do I need to do? A. You must be able to forget some of the success formula by which you are succeeding today. By definition, that's irrelevant. Secondly, you must be able to borrow one or two of the core assets of your company and lend them to the new idea. Q. What's the final part of the challenge? A. The new venture must learn to resolve uncertainties. There are always questions about the size of the market, what the customer needs, what the technology solutions are -- these are always unknown. It's the person who resolves the uncertainties and learns the fastest who will win. Q. Exactly who should manage the hot new idea? A. You must hire an outsider to run the breakthrough idea because insiders are always wedded to orthodoxy and the inside success formula. You must also hire liberally from outside. Hiring from within kills breakthrough innovation. And the business should report to the C.E.O. even if it is very small. It must get the same organizational status as other business units or it is going to be suffocated. Q. So would you say the chief executive has an important role in making breakthrough innovation possible? A. A tremendously important role. I consider the C.E.O.'s role in the modern corporation to be building the capacity to continuously innovate in a breakthrough way. The C.E.O. doesn't create the strategy, but should be listening to the voices of people who are able to see the future. It is the role of the C.E.O. to spot and encourage them. Then, once an idea has promise, you must help build a separate organization around that person.", "headline": {"main": "Novel Thinking As a Survival Tactic", "kicker": "OFFICE SPACE: ARMCHAIR M.B.A."}, "pub_date": "2006-01-01T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "Excerpts from conversation with Vijay Govindarajan, professor of international business at Dartmouth, on importance of break-through innovations to US economy and role of chief executive officers in building capacity to innovate; drawing (M)", "print_page": "8", "word_count": 890, "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/01/business/yourmoney/01advi.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2005/12/31/business/01advi.75.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2005/12/31/business/01advi.75.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}, {"height": 55, "subtype": "tiny_thumb", "legacy": {"tinythumbwidth": 55, "tinythumbheight": 55, "hastinythumb": "Y"}, "type": "image", "width": 55}], "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "GOVINDARAJAN, VIJAY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INCORPORATED"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "DARTMOUTH COLLEGE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "WORLD BANK"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES ECONOMY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HIRING AND PROMOTION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY"}], "subsection_name": null, "_id": "4fd269328eb7c8105d81f963", "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "William", "middlename": "J.", "lastname": "HOLSTEIN", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By WILLIAM J.

A10 Sharon in a Coma After Stroke Prime Minister Ariel Sharon lay in a deep coma as Israelis focused on a future -- and their future relations with the Palestinians -- without him in power. A1 The Bush administration, planning for a Middle East without Mr. Sharon, expressed hope that Israel would still follow Mr. Sharon's policies. But The White House faces difficult choices on how to make sure that happens. A12 Doctors in Jerusalem operated on Mr. Sharon's brain for a total of seven hours, then put him into an anesthesia-induced coma and connected him to a respirator, his medical team said.

A1 Miner's Missives Offer Resolve In four faint sentences of farewell and religious conviction, the words of Martin Toler Jr.'s note and similar missives from other miners, who were found dead in the wake of an unexplained explosion, offered a coda, at once heartbreaking and strangely consoling, to the emotional maelstrom of the past four days. A1 Explaining their decision to transfer the surviving miner to Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh, doctors said they hoped treatment there with hyperbaric oxygen would help him recover from a brain injury.

The group also includes Cerberus Capital Management and the Kimco Realty Corporation. A price was not disclosed but Albertson's has a market value of $8.93 billion and about $5.63 billion in debt. A transaction would give Supervalu, a discount grocer, more than 1,100 new stores in urban markets, including Chicago, and allow CVS, the drugstore chain, to add 700 stores, mostly in the West. Supervalu, based in Eden Prairie, Minn., currently operates more than 1,500 stores in 40 states.

(AP) Siemens Subsidiary Charged With Fraud in Chicago A subsidiary of Siemens and two of its executives have been indicted on charges of forming a sham partnership with a minority-owned company to land a $49 million county contract, federal prosecutors in Chicago said yesterday. The minority-owned company and its owner were also charged. Both were previously indicted on other charges. Siemens Medical Solutions USA was charged with fraudulently telling officials it was joining with minority-owned Faustech Industries in the bid to provide radiology equipment for a new hospital in Cook County. Prosecutors said Siemens had claimed the partnership with Faustech because county officials required bidders to have 30 percent minority ownership. According to the indictment, Siemens paid Faustech's owner, Faust Villazan, $500,000 to pose as a partner. A spokesman for Siemens said the company had broken no laws and would fight the charges. Mr. Villazan and Faustech have denied the charges. (AP) Fourth-Quarter Profit Declined at Johnson Controls Johnson Controls said yesterday that its earnings fell for the first time in almost five years in the fourth quarter, pulled down by expenses from its purchase of the York International Corporation and higher raw materials prices. Its forecast for second-quarter profit was lower than analysts' estimates, setting off an 8 percent decline in its stock price. Johnson Controls, which is the largest automotive seat maker, bought York's heating and air conditioning business to reduce its dependence on supplying auto companies. It expects sales from the climate control division to almost double in 2006. Johnson Controls, which is based in Milwaukee, said net income fell 1.8 percent, to $165.4 million, or 85 cents a share, and sales rose 14 percent, to $7.53 billion. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) Pension Fund Opposes Bank's Proposed Stake Sale The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest public pension fund, called on the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday to block a transaction between Sovereign Bancorp and Banco Santander Central Hispano of Spain because shareholders were not allowed to vote on it. The pension fund backed the efforts of Sovereign's largest shareholder, Relational Investors, to stop the bank from selling a 19.8 percent stake to Santander for $2.4 billion. Sovereign, which is based in Philadelphia, plans to use proceeds from the Santander transaction to help buy the Independence Community Bank Corporation of Brooklyn for $3.6 billion.

Whatever the board decides, the aggressive pursuit of a deal by Robert Iger, Disney's chief executive, speaks volumes about his own ambitions and how he perceives his company's future. [Page C1.] The calculus of Disney in seeking to acquire Pixar is simple: big media conglomerate plus vaunted computer animation studio plus closer ties with Steven P. Jobs, the maverick Pixar founder, equals potential powerhouse. But because Mr. Jobs's other job is chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer, a deal also raises the possibility of a warmer relationship between Disney and Apple if Mr. Jobs plays an active role at the company.

[C1.] New Health Site Aims to Challenge WebMD A new Web site owned by Healthline Networks acts as a medical search engine, finding articles on ailments and remedies from some 66,000 Web sites it has identified as providing medical content. In doing so, Healthline says it offers consumers a broader choice of information than WebMD, which is by far the most popular single medical resource online, and a more refined choice than general search engines like Google. Healthline's chairman and chief executive, West Shell III, above, said several factors argued in favor of the company's success this time around, after a similar venture was unsuccessful. Consumers remain deeply interested in online health information, he said, and pharmaceutical and other medical advertisers are starting to open their wallets more generously to the Web.

[A1.] Fourth-Quarter Sales Drop at Bristol-Myers Bristol-Myers Squibb has become the latest drug maker to post lower revenue, announcing a fourth-quarter sales decline of nearly 3 percent, to $5.02 billion, as competition increased for the cholesterol-lowering drug Pravachol, its second-biggest seller. The company said net income for the fourth quarter more than tripled to $499 million, or 26 cents a share, but that was largely because of lower tax costs. As uncertainties seemed to mount, Bristol-Myers predicted lower sales and earnings for 2006, with generic competition and patent losses weighing down sales.
