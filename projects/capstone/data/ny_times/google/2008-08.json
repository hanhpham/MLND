Our wife, mother, mother-inlaw and grandmother, Martha Farkas Robbins, who was devoted to her family and its matriarch and historian, died on August 24 at the age of 85. Committed to Judaism, she lived her life guided by its values and invigorated by its intellectualism, fostering its strains of feminism and fighting its strains of dogmatism. Though short in physical stature, she was a towering presence. A college professor and voracious reader, she had an encyclopedic memory and boundless curiosity. In fact, she was such a Renaissance woman that even in this age of Google, her grandchildren, when faced with a question, often said, ''I'll call Grandma.'' She was passionate about politics (an unwavering Democrat); a devotee of opera and talented if intermittent pianist; an avid traveler; and an incomparable cook. We will greatly miss her infinite wisdom, quiet elegance, unfailing perfectionism and, most of all, her deep love of family and friends that shone through all she did.
