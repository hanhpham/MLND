The relatively young and politically disorganized tech industry has found its voice in opposing the bills, which it says would go too far \u2014 potentially violating free speech and stifling innovation \u2014 by allowing media companies to shut down Web sites they say are abusing copyrights. It\u2019s an issue that has led to a rare show of unity for the industry\u2019s players \u2014 from venture capitalists to the smallest Web sites. <p> The bills <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/us/white-house-says-it-opposes-parts-of-2-antipiracy-bills.html?ref=technology\">have been shelved</a> for the time being, but the industry is not letting up in trying to sway public opinion. On Wednesday, a Web-wide protest includes a 24-hour shutdown of the English-language Wikipedia site. The main pages of several other sites, including <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"http://newyork.craigslist.org/\">Craigslist</a> <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/\">and Wired</a>, also reflect their opposition to the bills. Rallies are planned Wednesday in New York, San Francisco and Seattle. And in Washington the lobbying remains fierce from both supporters and opponents of the legislation. </p><p> Around the Web, the controversy over the bills and the protests also received wide attention. At The Atlantic Megan Garber <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/the-discussion-that-led-to-the-wikipedia-blackout-is-pretty-amazing/251491/\">wrote about</a> the discussion within Wikipedia that led to the discussion to shut down. On Mashable, Chris Heald <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2012/01/17/sopa-dangerous-opinion/\">analyzed the legislation</a> in detail to explain the arguments against it.
