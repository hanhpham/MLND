The White House said it would release emergency oil stockpiles to meet shortages and would relax environmental standards nationwide. [Page A1.] After one of the worst storms ever to hit the Gulf Coast, large parts of the nation's distribution system had shut down, slowing down imports and exports. One result could be that American consumers will be paying more for everything from coffee and bananas to paint and tires. [C1.] From as far away as Massachusetts and Ohio, convoys of utility trucks and reinforcement workers are descending on the storm-damaged region to restore electricity to the estimated 1.7 million household and business customers still without power.

Falling oil prices also helped stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 68.78 points, to 10,481.60. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 11.92 points, to 1,220.33, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 22.33 points, to 2,152.09.

Approves Drug for Children's Growth The Food and Drug Administration gave approval to the first new drug in 30 years for the treatment of abnormally short stature in children. It is the first drug approved for Tercica, a biotechnology company based in Brisbane, Calif. An estimated 6,000 children in this country have the specific condition for which the F.D.A. approved the drug, although some doctors expect it to be more broadly prescribed to children with less severe growth abnormalities.

The exodus has turned into an embarrassing and costly setback for Vodafone -- and one it is now struggling to overcome. Vodafone, which is based in London and also owns 45 percent of Verizon Wireless in the United States, now must win back customers if it is to revive what was once one of its most profitable units and a cash cow for its global operations.

A3 Iran Rejects Europe's Demand Iran rejected a call by Europe to halt its nuclear program in two weeks or face possible Security Council penalties, and said it would not give in to what it called bullying. A3 Egypt to Ignore Poll Monitors The counry's electoral commission said that it would not abide by a court ruling authorizing non-government organizations to monitor the coming election for president, a decision that effectively placed the commission above the law and called into question the integrity of the vote scheduled to take place on Wednesday. A4 Egyptian investigators say they have concluded that three recent attacks in the Sinai Peninsula were linked. The assaults included the bombings at Taba in October and Sharm el Sheik in July and a smaller attack in August on peacekeepers in the Sinai. A4 Schr\u00f6der Debates Candidate Germany's conservative leader, Angela Merkel, accused Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der of saddling the country with record high unemployment and a faltering economy, as the two met in a televised debate two weeks before an election that most polls predict will make Mrs. Merkel the first female chancellor in German history.

A6 NATIONAL A7-19 New Orleans SearchersAttention to the Dead Troops patrolled the streets, rescuers hunted for stragglers and New Orleans looked like a wrecked ghost town as the evacuation of the city neared completion and officials turned to the task of collecting bodies in a ghastly landscape awash in possibly thousands of corpses. A1 As the Bush administration tried to show a more forceful effort to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina, government officials escalated their criticism and sniping over who was to blame for the problems with the initial response. A1 Strained by an influx of refugees , Texas struggled to house about a quarter-million victims of Hurricane Katrina in shelters and hotel rooms and began organizing an emergency airlift to divert thousands more to other states. A13 The devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina became a rallying cry for African-American religious and political leaders in Houston, President Bush's former hometown, with pleas for charity mixed with a seething anger at the response to the crisis. A10 Perhaps not since Richard M. Nixon faced Vietnam-era tumult abroad and at home has an American president had to meet quite the combination of foreign war, domestic tribulations and political division that President Bush now confronts, from the Persian Gulf to the Gulf Coast to Capitol Hill. A1 New Orleans police officers shot and killed four people and wounded two others who had fired at officers escorting a convoy of contractors across a bridge, the authorities said. A13 Rehnquist Death Stirs Battle The death of Chief Justice William H.

A senior Republican aide said the schedule for the Roberts confirmation hearings, which had been set to begin Tuesday, was expected to be revised. A1 Advocacy groups on the left and the right scrambled to adjust to what had suddenly become a far more complicated struggle over judicial nominations with the death of Chief Justice Rehnquist. A19 William H. Rehnquist, who died at the age of 80, almost a year after learning he had thyroid cancer, helped lead a conservative revolution on the Supreme Court during 19 years as chief justice of the United States. A17 Supreme Court justices say they were as surprised as the rest of the country to learn that the chief justice had died. A19 Labor Leaders See Opportunity As they have on past Labor Days, the nation's union leaders are vowing to reverse labor's decline, but that goal is made more difficult this year by the schism in the A.F.L.-C.I.O. A7 NEW YORK/REGION B1-5 Candidates CriticizeResponse to Hurricane Outrage over the federal government's response to Hurricane Katrina has worked its way into New York City's mayoral campaign, with the leading Democratic candidates using the crisis as a vehicle for broader assertions that Republicans have neglected the poor. While the candidates were careful not to attack Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's response to the crisis, all four directed sharp rebukes at the Bush administration. B1 New Strategy in Yonkers Mayor Philip A. Amicone of Yonkers has recently held several town hall-style forums, urging residents to voice their opinions and ask questions of city officials. The meetings might be rather unremarkable in other places, but in a city where a history of nepotism fuels a sense of frustration and cynicism, the openness is a major shift in strategy and is giving some residents a reason for cautious optimism. B1 SPORTSMONDAY D1-9 Elder Sister Wins Sibling Match The atmosphere in the all-Williams tennis match bore scant resemblance to the floodlit, electrically charged ambiance in their United States Open night finals past.

But the makeup of the Gulf Coast work force -- heavy on warehouse employees and blackjack dealers, light on bankers and factory workers -- has already complicated relief efforts and appears likely to worsen Hurricane Katrina's economic damage. [Page C1.] The nation's gasoline inventories fell to their lowest levels in almost five years last week, the government said, quantifying for the first time Hurricane Katrina's impact on energy supplies and production. [C5.] As fuel prices rise, so too has the number of people who are stealing gasoline. Gas station owners are reporting a surge in the number of drivers who pull up to the pump, fill up and drive off without paying.

The crowd, the news release insisted, was made up of Fun Fearless Females; said females were garbed in designer jeans and expensive stilettos, sipping drinks, ordering drinks and, in one case, fearlessly falling down the stairs upon exiting one of the portable toilets.

According to Nielsen Bookscan, which tracks sales from major booksellers, only 2 percent of the 1.2 million unique titles sold in 2004 had sales of more than 5,000 copies. Against this backdrop, the recent Authors Guild suit against the Google Library Project is poignantly wrongheaded. The Authors Guild claims that Google's plan to make the collections of five major libraries searchable online violates copyright law and thus harms authors' interests. As both an author and publisher, I find the Guild's position to be exactly backward. Google Library promises to be a boon to authors, publishers and readers if Google sticks to its stated goal of creating a tool that helps people discover (and potentially pay for) copyrighted works.
