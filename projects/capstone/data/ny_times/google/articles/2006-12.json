The sites offer search boxes and product directories, typically presenting items so that when users click on a link, they are in essence clicking on a merchant's ad. But new sites, like Jellyfish, TheFind and MyTriggers, are taking advantage of an increasing discomfort with the pay-per-click model. On these new sites, advertisers typically pay only when someone buys something or when users view an ad. E-Commerce Report, Bob Tedeschi. [C6.] AN OUTLET FOR PHOTOS -- Hoping to turn the millions of people with digital cameras and camera phones into photojournalists, Yahoo and Reuters are introducing an effort to showcase photographs and video of news events submitted by the public. Starting tomorrow, the photos and videos submitted will be placed throughout Reuters.com and Yahoo News. Reuters said that it would start to distribute some submissions to media outlets that subscribe to its news service. [C6.] ARTICLE BLOCKED IN RUSSIA -- In a sign of the growing reach of Russia's business elite, a billionaire, Yelena Baturina, tried -- and for a time succeeded -- in blocking an article in the Russian edition of Forbes magazine that featured her on its cover. The episode again raised questions about intimidation of the press. The December edition appeared on newsstands a day late and after the editor in chief, Maksim Kashulinsky, above, resigned in protest. [C4.] ASK GOES LOCAL -- Like every other major search company, Ask would like to narrow Google's lead, and it has made some progress. In the last four months, Ask has regained market share that it lost last year. And on Monday, Ask.com is introducing AskCity, a service that integrates maps with information about local businesses, restaurants, concerts and movies. [C1.] IN BRITAIN, THE ONLINE FUTURE -- Online advertising in Britain offers a glimpse of the future for the ad world, growing at a roughly 40 percent annual rate. It is expected to account for as much as 14 percent of overall ad spending this year in Britain, the highest level in the world, and more than double the percentage in America. Advertising. [C1.] WAL-MART TRIES TO RAISE MORALE -- Faced with demonstrations of discontent by its employees, Wal-Mart Stores has developed a program to show that it appreciates its 1.3 million workers in the United States and to encourage them to air their grievances. As part of the effort, Wal-Mart managers will hold monthly meetings with rank-and-file workers and extend a 10 percent discount on a single product during the holidays to all its employees. [C1.] WA LL STREET JOURNAL REDESIGN -- Executives of The Wall Street Journal will unveil today the prototype for its redesign, part of a $100 million overhaul beginning on Jan. 2 that will shrink the physical size of the paper. This will save money but also reduce the space devoted to news by 10 percent. Many of the changes are intended to help the time-pressed reader move through the paper faster. [C4.] PRIME-TIME CHANGES AT CNN -- While the daytime ratings at Headline News have grown a modest 10 percent among viewers coveted by advertisers, those from ages 25 to 54, the ratings are up 48 percent at Headline Prime, the prime-time program that summarizes the news, into brash, personality-driven talk-TV. But with the improved ratings come a question: how can CNN compete with the more opinionated prime-time competition while preserving its reputation as an objective news gatherer? [C1.] FOCUS ON TELECOM GROUP -- This week, the International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency representing 191 countries and 650 companies, puts on the telecommunications industry's biggest gathering, called ITU Telecom World. But some of the conference's attention will be focused on the role of the ITU itself. Should it concern itself with Internet governance, or should it focus on more basic issues, like access to telecommunications in developing countries? [C12.] CITGO PAYS FOR ADS -- Citizens Energy Corporation, the nonprofit heating assistance program, supplies low-income households with oil provided by Citgo, the state-owned Venezuelan oil company. Now for the first time Citgo is also funding Citizens' television commercials, left. The commercials, which advertise ''heating oil at 40 percent off from our friends in Venezuela at Citgo,'' began airing on Nov. 17 in local television markets for the 16 states reached by Citizens Energy. Citgo supplied Citizens with oil last year, but this year is the first time that Citgo will be paying for the Citizens commercials. [C8.] A SALE, BUT NOT A TITLE -- When HarperCollins announced the impending release of ''If I Did It,'' O. J. Simpson's book about his ex-wife's murder, the title, author and subject came as a surprise to almost everyone -- including the booksellers who had already ordered the book. Mr. Simpson's book, which was canceled, was sold ''blind'' to bookstores a few weeks before its release, a phenomena that is increasingly common in the publishing industry. [C8.] VIDEO GAMES ON TV -- Competitive video gaming is going to get shot at mainstream network treatment when an hourlong special about the World Series of Video Games appears as part of the CBS Sports Spectacular lineup on Dec. 30.
