Thomson's recently published book, ''Blueprint to a Billion: Seven Essentials to Achieve Exponential Growth,'' takes a different approach. Mr. Thomson evaluates patterns shared by what he calls ''blueprint companies'' -- the 387 businesses that have gone public since 1980 and have reached $1 billion in revenue. These star businesses represent just 5 percent of the companies that have gone public in that time frame, yet they accounted for more than half of their employment and two-thirds of their market value in 2005. Many of them are household names: Microsoft, Starbucks, Google, Nike, Genentech and Staples. Mr. Thomson notes that of the 4,000 publicly traded companies with $30 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, only 30 become billion-dollar businesses each year.

[C1.] INTEL'S INTERNET PLAN -- Intel plans to announce a design for a sub-$400 educational laptop and a five-year, $1 billion program to train teachers and to extend wireless digital Internet access worldwide.
