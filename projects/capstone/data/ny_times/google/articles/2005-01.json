The Vandals, a Southern California band known for catchy riffs and lowbrow humor, played a one-hour show for the 3rd Brigade of the Army's 1st Cavalry Division, The Associated Press reported. The band played some of its snarky not-quite-hits like ''Oi to the World'' and ''Anarchy Burger (Hold the Government)'' for the troops, with a handful of soldiers forming a mosh pit. ''There aren't many real punk rockers in the Army,'' said Matthew Linus Byars, 31, a medic from Nashville. ''I just kind of blew off Christmas as another day of work, but this was really special to me.'' The Vandals were on a two-week tour that took them to many military bases; it ended on New Year's Day in Kuwait. At the modestly attended show in Baghdad, the band members acknowledged that they did not have quite the drawing power of recent guests like the country singer Toby Keith or the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, but they said they were pleased with the crowds. ''You rock out to the band you have,'' said the guitarist, Warren Fitzgerald, above, echoing Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, ''not the band you wish you had.'' Preparing Central Park Forklifts are to begin moving 15,000 steel braces into place in Central Park today in preparation for the long-awaited public artwork by Christo and Jeanne-Claude that is to feature 23 miles of saffron-colored fabric hanging from 16-foot gates through the park, The Associated Press reported. Weather permitting, workers are to begin placing the braces along the paths, working in two shifts from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. each day. On Feb. 7, vinyl poles are to be attached to the bases to form the gates; the fabric will be unfurled on Feb. 12, and the project, called ''The Gates, Central Park, New York, 1979-2005,'' will remain up through Feb. 27. The artists are reportedly paying for the project without any sponsorships or donations, and said they hoped the final cost would be under $21 million. Portions of an unfinished documentary by Albert Maysles about the artwork will be shown at the Gallery at Herm\u00e8s, at 691 Madison Avenue (at 60th Street), from Jan. 19 to Feb. 27. The film, ''The Gates,'' traces the history of the project, which was at first rejected by the city in 1981. Selections from Mr. Maysles's five other films about Christo and Jeanne-Claude, dating from 1974, will also be shown. A Song for Tsunami Relief Sir Cliff Richard, below, and Boy George are among the British pop stars lined up to record a new charity song for survivors of the Indian Ocean tsunami. The song, ''Grief Never Grows Old,'' written by Mike Read, a British radio D.J., is to be recorded by an ad hoc group of celebrities and released under the name One World Project. Others being approached for the project include Robin and Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees, Olivia Newton-John and the young jazz singer Jamie Cullum, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported. The backing track has been completed, and Sir Cliff and Boy George have already recorded their parts. The song should be finished in one week, and the producers hope to raise $4 million. Bit by Bit, Stealing A London Museum An attendant at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London stole 2,544 items, from the 1930's to the 50's, prompting a security review in 1954, according to records recently released by Britain's National Archives, the BBC reported. The stolen items included prints, oil paintings, musical instruments, ceramics, lacquer boxes, 98 Japanese swords and two imitation 18th-century French tables. The man, whose name was identified in the report as Nevin, worked in the museum's circulation department. The thefts went undetected for years because the museum had not done an inventory. The report said about 100 of the recovered items were irreparably damaged. Nevin eventually served three years in prison. The Victoria and Albert has suffered from a series of thefts in recent months (a set of bronze plaques worth almost $1 million was stolen last week), prompting what museum directors call a major security overhaul. Honors for Pops King Skitch Henderson, the founder of the New York Pops and the longtime music director for NBC Television, will be given the James Smithson Bicentennial Medal from the Smithsonian Institution for his contributions to American music. The award will be presented in a ceremony on Jan. 29 at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, featuring performances by the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, with Mr. Henderson sitting in on piano for a song or two. A related exhibition, ''Skitch Henderson: A Man and His Music,'' is to run at the Smithsonian Institution Building (the ''Castle'') through mid-March. Born Lyle Russell Cedric Henderson in Birmingham, England, in 1918, Mr. Henderson toured with Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney, and with Bob Hope's Pepsodent Show, and was the musical director for Frank Sinatra's Lucky Strike show on NBC Radio; Bing Crosby gave him his nickname. Previous winners of the medal, which is named after the Smithsonian's founder, have included Sir David Attenborough, Artie Shaw, Celia Cruz, Dave Brubeck, Jerry Lee Lewis, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Jim Henson. They Like the Nightlife The winners of the 2005 Nightlife Awards for jazz, comedy and cabaret performers in New York City have been announced. The winners, in 16 categories, include Karen Akers, right, Keely Smith and Liz and Ann Hampton Callaway (cabaret); Laurie Kilmartin, Patrice O'Neal and ''Dave Gorman's Googlewhack! Adventure'' (comedy); and Bill Charlap, Joe Lovano and Paula West (jazz). Posthumous honors went to the singer Jackie Paris and the composer Cy Coleman. The awards, chosen by a panel of critics and experts, will be given in a performance-only ceremony -- no speeches allowed -- on Jan. 31 at Town Hall, with guests including Joy Behar, Bruce Vilanch, Sutton Foster, Ute Lemper, Maureen McGovern and Kate Clinton. Footnotes The New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players will offer a 125th-anniversary production of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' starring Hal Linden, right, at City Center beginning Friday. The show was first performed at the Fifth Avenue Theater in New York on Dec. 31, 1879; it was Gilbert and Sullivan's fifth collaboration and their only operetta to have its premiere in the United States. The show, with Mr. Linden taking on his first Gilbert and Suillivan role as the batty Maj. Gen. Stanley, will continue through Jan. 23. ... The long-running Highlights in Jazz series, now in its 32nd season, will present a tribute to early jazz on Thursday at the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, with Wycliffe Gordon, Ken Peplowski, Randy Sandke and Carrie Smith, as well as the Manhattan Ragtime Orchestra. The program has yet to be announced, but expect some Benny Goodman: Mr. Peplowski, a clarinetist, and Mr. Sandke, a trumpeter, both played with Goodman late in his career.
