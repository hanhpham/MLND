The company says it has 1.1 million subscribers. Here are excerpts from an interview: Q. How big is the market in the United States for online dating? A. The market is very big and it's growing rapidly. We've done the single most extensive study of the singles market and we found there are some 90 million single people over the age of 18. Of that 90 million, approximately 33 million are currently looking for an enduring relationship. Q. The field is dominated by three players: your company, Yahoo Personals and eHarmony. What is your competitive strength? A. Most of the people on our site are willing to post multiple photographs of themselves when they're filling out their profile. They've got complete essays that describe their backgrounds and their interests. So if you're interested in meeting somebody, it's much easier to find that person when you're interacting with all those profiles. Q. Do you specialize in a certain demographic or age group? A. A lot of people presume that online dating at Match.com is for the youth segment, meaning 18- to 25-year-olds. But it turns out, in the age range of 18 to 25, they've already got lots of possibilities to meet people. Their social system allows them to interact with all sorts of single people. Our average customer is in their mid-30's. Many people have already been through a serious relationship or a marriage that didn't work out. When you've been with one person for a longer period of time, your social circle pivots around that person. When you find yourself single again, you need to expand your possibilities. Q. What's the gender breakout of your clientele? A. We've got slightly more men than women. It's about 55 percent to 45 percent. Q. How do you segment your market? A. We have identified three segments. It doesn't really break down by male or female, or even by age. It breaks down by behaviors. One is the ''broaden my options'' segment, which is the core Match segment. They were the early adopters. The next segment we call the ''find my match'' segment and then there's the ''give me help'' segment. They're roughly equal in size. The difference is in how comfortable they are online and how much advice and guidance they want. Q. What does it say about American culture that so many people are going online to meet? A. If you think about how anyone meets anyone these days, the Internet is so much a part of our social ecosystem that it's perfectly normal, based on where people spend their time, that this might be an environment where people actually meet each other. It says a lot about where we are as a society and our adoption of technology, and how mainstream and normal the Internet feels. Q. What are you trying to do globally? A. We think markets in Europe and Asia Pacific are about 18 to 24 months behind where the United States is in online dating. But I think three to five years from now, 50 percent of our business will be overseas. We've got the No. 1 market share position in Europe and we've got some early ventures in Japan. We're looking actively at China. We've got an operation in Australia. Q. How are you overcoming the cultural differences in, say, Japan? A. The idea of relationships and people falling in love is similar globally. But the process by which they do it is different. In Japan, where we've just launched our mobile, or cellphone, service, it's much more of a youth market that's experimenting with the service. It's not unlike the U.S., where initially there was a vicarious curiosity. That curiosity turns into serious intent because people find it really is an effective way to meet people who might be outside your existing social circle. Q. What about France? A. When it comes to a product about love, the French don't want to take any advice from anyone but the French. So even though we have a global platform, we have local management teams in each country that customize the software so that it looks and feels like it's being produced in that country. When you're doing a search within any given country or any given city, the people you're seeing are all local people. Localization is absolutely key. If it smells like an American product built for connecting French people for love, they'll reject it immediately. Q. How did Match.com survive the bursting of the dot-com bubble? A. I wasn't there for the bursting of the bubble and the reigniting of the Internet thereafter. But one of the things about Match, like the other companies that survived, is that it's a real business that wasn't built on metrics like ''unique users'' and ''page views.'' We are a subscription-based business, so there were real paying subscribers. There was a community of people and it had a network effect. The more people signed up and found value, it generated more subscribers. It's been profitable but revenues were flat. The challenge for me was to reignite growth. In this year's second quarter, we grew our revenue by 26 percent.", "headline": {"main": "For Some Searches, Google Won't Do", "kicker": "OFFICE SPACE: ARMCHAIR M.B.A."}, "pub_date": "2005-11-06T00:00:00Z", "abstract": null, "print_page": "9", "word_count": 910, "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/06/business/yourmoney/06advi.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2005/11/05/business/06advi.75.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2005/11/05/business/06advi.75.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}, {"height": 55, "subtype": "tiny_thumb", "legacy": {"tinythumbwidth": 55, "tinythumbheight": 55, "hastinythumb": "Y"}, "type": "image", "width": 55}], "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "MATCH.COM"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "IAC/INTERACTIVECORP"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DATING (SOCIAL)"}], "subsection_name": null, "_id": "4fd2510d8eb7c8105d7f51a2", "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "William", "middlename": "J.", "lastname": "HOLSTEIN", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By WILLIAM J.

Three years ago, Grant Achatz, the chef and owner of Alinea in Chicago, Googled an industrial designer, Martin Kastner, and they began collaborating on new ways of serving food: suspending seasoned bacon from a strand of steel tension wire; setting plates on aromatic pillows; nestling pork tempura and a laurel branch into a cluster of wires they call ''the squid.''

Long considered the David to Microsoft's Goliath, Google is increasingly being thought of as a Goliath itself.", "headline": {"main": "Big Google Becomes Big Target", "kicker": "WHAT'S ONLINE"}, "pub_date": "2005-11-26T00:00:00Z", "abstract": null, "print_page": "5", "word_count": 668, "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/26/technology/26online.ready.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2005/11/25/business/26online_75.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2005/11/25/business/26online_75.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}, {"height": 55, "subtype": "tiny_thumb", "legacy": {"tinythumbwidth": 55, "tinythumbheight": 55, "hastinythumb": "Y"}, "type": "image", "width": 55}], "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "GOOGLE INC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}], "subsection_name": null, "_id": "4fd2a9ff8eb7c8105d89579a", "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Dan", "lastname": "MITCHELL"}], "original": "By DAN MITCHELL"}, "section_name": "Technology; Business"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "snippet": "TIVO TAKEOUT    The News -- On Monday, TiVo, the maker of digital video recorders, announced that its subscribers will be able to transfer recorded television programs onto their Apple video iPods and Sony handheld PSP game machines.

The new service builds on the company's TiVo to Go feature, which allows some subscribers to transfer shows to a laptop or personal computer. Behind the News -- The television networks have yet another reason to hate TiVo, which first encroached on their turf by offering viewers the ability to watch television shows when they wanted, without the commercials. Now, TiVo could hurt the networks' attempts to develop another revenue stream by selling shows by the episode. For instance, ABC plans to sell downloads of ''Desperate Housewives'' on Apple iPods for 99 cents. But why pay, when you can download from TiVo for free? X-GAMES BEGIN The News -- Microsoft released its Xbox 360, its next-generation game machine, at midnight on Tuesday. Buyers lined up for hours to be among the first to purchase it.

The real question is whether the 360 can outsell Sony's next-generation game console, PlayStation 3, which is not due out until spring. LIBRARY DOWNLOAD The News -- Google gave $3 million to help the Library of Congress build a World Digital Library on the Web. For the project, the National Library of Egypt has already agreed to digitize documents of Islamic science from the 10th century. Behind the News -- Google's gift may be good public relations. The Library of Congress emphasized that Google's gift comes with no strings attached and no copyright problems. That would be welcome news for Google, which has faced copyright issues because of its Book Search project, a book- scanning effort in partnership with five research libraries. GOODNIGHT, TED The News -- On Tuesday, Ted Koppel, the anchor of ''Nightline'' ended his 25-year reign as late night's Mr. Serious. Behind the News -- Will ''Nightline'' survive? Under Mr. Koppel, it has struggled in the ratings, generally falling behind NBC's ''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno'' and CBS's ''Late Show With David Letterman.'' Now, three anchors will replace Mr. Koppel, and it's unknown how quickly ABC expects ratings success.", "headline": {"main": "New Media In, Old-Media Star Out | Nov. 20-26", "kicker": "THE WEEK"}, "pub_date": "2005-11-27T00:00:00Z", "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 444, "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E5D91731F934A15752C1A9639C8B63", "multimedia": [], "keywords": [], "subsection_name": null, "_id": "4fd251148eb7c8105d7f5696", "byline": null, "section_name": "Week in Review"}, {"type_of_material": "Editorial", "snippet": "Google should do a better job of including users in decisions about how their personal information is collected, stored, and shared....", "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "lead_paragraph": "At a North Carolina strangulation-murder trial this month, prosecutors announced an unusual piece of evidence: Google searches allegedly done by the defendant that included the words ''neck'' and ''snap.''

A1 In private conversations, American officials are beginning to acknowledge that a judgment about when withdrawals from Iraq can begin is driven by two political calendars -- one in Iraq and one in the United States -- as much as by military assessments.

A1 Graft Endangers Caspian Fish Although international and domestic regulations protect the sturgeon on paper, manifest lawlessness and graft in the Caspian region have led to unchecked fishing and struggling hatcheries.

A1 Group Rallies for Prisoner A group called Trial and Error, which claims a membership in the thousands, is trying to free a man convicted 16 years ago of what many consider to be Maine's most notorious crime. Many law enforcement officials, however, remain convinced that he is the killer. A13 Catholics Split on Gay Priests Grappling with the implications of a Vatican directive issued last week that would bar most gay men from seminaries, Roman Catholics at parishes around the country offered contrasting interpretations of its impact on the priesthood, on the potential for future sexual abuse by clergy members and on the church itself. A13 Golf and Archaeology Clash The Newark Earthworks, a sprawling and complex series of earthen mounds sculpted by the Hopewell Indians 2,000 years ago, is now home of the Moundbuilders Country Club.

E7 OBITUARIES B7 BUSINESS DAY C1-14 Discount Chains Thrive As the nation's retail executives began poring over, and in some cases, despairing over sales receipts from the holiday weekend, one pattern became clearer: consumers mobbed discount chains, but largely shopped right past other specialty retailers at the mall.
