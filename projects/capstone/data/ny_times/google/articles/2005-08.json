But damned if he didn't go and ruin it all with utterly confusing asides touching on sex and idiom. Rubin might have lifted the charge that I am incompetent when writing on sex from Google, the charge having been aired several times in reviews of my books in the Book Review. ''Buckley's sex scenes have always been vulgar and prudish simultaneously -- neat trick.'' If so neat, why not acclaimed? But they are also mystifying. I once had to advise The Times, whose reviewer had made fun of a sex scene, that I couldn't prove my point by quoting it, inasmuch as to do so would generate an unwelcome ardor. Well, O.K. -- other people's sex scenes are ungainly. But Rubin goes flying off by designating some as stopping ''just short of homoerotic.'' I am quite simply stupefied. There is nothing that hints of brotherly love in the book. Rubin is capable of just plain getting things wrong. ''Gus . . . sleeps with the woman Oakes ends up proposing to.'' No, he doesn't. He tries to sleep with her (before Oakes's involvement) and is turned down. The reviewer closes down even on acts of imagination that sustain the narrative. ''Gus, a young deep-cover agent who jokingly calls Oakes 'Dad.' '' But you see, in the preceding novel, Gus appears on the scene precisely as the son of Blackford. They are engaged in an extensive C.I.A. operation in the Soviet Union. Obviously, he called him ''Dad.'' In the spy world, if a young American visitor undertakes an imposture as the son of a senior American visitor, he is going to call him Dad. If he continues to call him that in a subsequent novel, is that a joke? Or even jokey? But it is nice that Rubin regrets the end of the series, even if he rejects my antonomasia. William F.

That is, this Detroit native and questing Christian, now living in Brooklyn, believes in every state's right to be the subject of a gentle, exhaustive album. His second offering in this monumental project, ''Illinois'' (Asthmatic Kitty), is a 22-song swing through Prairie State history. Of course, historical tidbits like the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, homesteader hardship and the relative debating talents of Lincoln and Douglas mostly provide a jump-off for self-reflection. A man of his times, the 30-year-old Mr. Stevens, above, is both a legitimate history buff and a Google tourist. He is imbued with an outward-looking, Copland-esque musical vision and a narcissistic idea of the surveyable self reminiscent of Walt Whitman, though his lyrics can have an emo overreach and his compositions tend to forge into the folksily baroque. But his quiet, assured voice and pained personal revelations keep things intimate. At his best, Mr. Stevens has our pleasure in mind, as when the humorously titled ''Come on, Feel the Illinoise'' slides out of its complex meter into a simpler rhythm. When Mr. Stevens's lyrical approach succeeds, as in his account of a friend's death from bone cancer, falling on Casimir Pulaski Day, it can be breathtaking. When it doesn't, it can be a trifle maddening, especially when the melody is indelible. An antifolk aria about John Wayne Gacy disingenuously turns a falsetto lament for the killer's victims into an inward-looking recrimination. But such indulgences are forgivable for an emotional cartographer who promises so much.

She lectures frequently and doesn't actually swear off interviews, but when we recently asked her to talk about herself, her first reaction was typical: ''Couldn't I wriggle out of this?'' Stasio is smart, funny and, even after 17 years of writing the Book Review's crime column, ''kind of passionate'' about what she does. ''I've always been analytical,'' she says. ''I loved algebra in school.'' So it's natural that she's less interested in writing ''thumbs up, thumbs down'' reviews than in figuring out why a book works -- or doesn't. She started out as a fan of classical puzzle mysteries, then fell for hard-boiled writers like Chandler and Hammett. These days, she's a particular champion of small-press mysteries, which are often foreign imports or reprints of classic novels from earlier eras. The mystery field continues to unfold new riches: ''There are so many moving parts, so many subgenres and categories, with new ones turning up all the time.'' In a special essay this week, she turns her attention to one of the newest -- what's come to be known as the chick-lit mystery.

The party's liberal base is pressing for a vigorous fight against Judge Roberts as documents from the Reagan administration clarify his conservative credentials.
