And last night he capped it all off with a convention speech that somberly recalled Sept. 11, introduced the president and incidentally introduced himself to national Republicans, whom he hopes to woo as he sets the stage for a possible presidential run in 2008.", "headline": {"main": "Pataki's Speech Caps a Week of Parties and Promotion", "kicker": "THE REPUBLICANS: THE CONVENTION IN NEW YORK -- THE GOVERNOR"}, "pub_date": "2004-09-03T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "Gov George E Pataki caps frenzied week playing host to Republican National Convention by introducing Pres Bush; photo (M)", "print_page": "6", "word_count": 927, "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/03/politics/campaign/03pataki.html", "multimedia": [], "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "PATAKI, GEORGE E"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BUSH, GEORGE W"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "REPUBLICAN PARTY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CONVENTIONS, NATIONAL (US)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2004"}], "subsection_name": null, "_id": "4fd259a68eb7c8105d805c49", "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Michael", "lastname": "COOPER"}], "original": "By MICHAEL COOPER"}, "section_name": "U.S."}, {"type_of_material": "News", "snippet": "Skype is the easiest, fastest and cheapest way for individual customers to use their computers with broadband connections as telephones....", "news_desk": "SundayBusiness", "lead_paragraph": "HOW big a deal will Skype turn out to be?
