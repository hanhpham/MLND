The three adult children, from Stern's second marriage, had sued the former executor, William Moorhead III, for more than $2 million, contending that he had improperly valued the estate and transferred assets to the third wife of the violinist. (Stern, right, died in 2001.) Judge Martin Landgrebe also criticized Mr. Moorhead for paying himself $313,000, calling it ''outrageous, improper and unjustified.'' He ordered that the money be repaid, along with $250,000 spent on a Central Park West apartment used by Mr. Moorhead as an office from which to manage the estate. The judge also said that selling items like violins that had been bequeathed to the children caused them to suffer ''incalculable personal loss.'' The children are Michael Stern, the music director of the Kansas City Symphony; David, also a conductor; and Shira, a rabbi. On the Road to Cooperstown Jack Kerouac was not known for his baseball skills, but he is now in the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. Well, at least his bobblehead doll, left, is, The Associated Press reported. ''Having the Jack Kerouac bobblehead in our collection is important, given he's an American icon who had a deep passion for the game, which he shared in his writing,'' said Jeff Idelson, a spokesman for the hall. Luring fans to the ballpark more than seven hours before a game in August 2003 in Lowell, Mass., Kerouac's birthplace, the doll was a giveaway to the first thousand by the Lowell Spinners, a Boston Red Sox affiliate in the Class A New York-Penn League. But demand was so great that the team created 500 more, which were used to raise more than $10,000 for Jack Kerouac Scholarships before the mold was destroyed to prevent unauthorized reproductions. Glengarry's Tonys In a surprise for the producers of David Mamet's ''Glengarry Glen Ross,'' the Tony Awards administration committee decided yesterday that the show's entire cast would be considered eligible for the featured, or supporting, actor category. Producers of the revival had expected that Alan Alda, who plays Shelly Levene, the play's sad sack hero, would be considered a leading actor, a category with fewer potential nominees and thus less competition. (Nominations for the Tony Awards, scheduled for June 5, will be announced on Tuesday.) Jeffrey Richards, a producer of the show, said, ''There will be an official appeal, since not everybody who was on the committee had seen the play.'' Lip Service On a day when Britons went to the polls in general elections, Mark McGowan, below, a performance artist and art history student, spent his time yesterday planting what he said would be 100,000 kisses on a photograph of Prime Minister Tony Blair near his office on Downing Street, Agence France-Presse reported. ''I notice he has been getting a lot of abuse, and I just wanted to show him some affection today, and 100,000 kisses seemed like a lot,'' said Mr. McGowan, whose effort represented an appeal for Britons and Mr. Blair to kiss and make up. Mr. McGowan, left, who once walked for 11 miles through London with a 27-pound turkey strapped to his head to persuade the overweight to eat less, said he planned to achieve yesterday's goal in eight hours by means of 50-kiss bursts interrupted by breaks to rest his jaws and moisturize his lips. Ancient Beauty Adorned with a golden mask, many colors and scenes depicting ancient Egyptian rituals and life, a mummy described as the most beautiful ever unearthed has been introduced in Cairo by Egyptian archaeological experts, Agence France-Presse reported. Dating to 378 to 341 B.C., it was found almost intact during excavations around the pyramids in Saqqara. Europe's Cultural Concerns European Union cultural officials have been urged to create a digital library of European literature amid fears that Google's plans to digitize works from leading libraries in the United States and Britain and make them freely available online will lead to future American domination of worldwide culture, Agence France-Presse reported. ''We have to act,'' Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister of Luxembourg, told a meeting in Paris of culture ministers and 800 artists and intellectuals who drew up a European culture charter.
