The news last week was full of stories about how the Web phenom Twitter might make a buck as the rest of the economy goes up in smoke, from charging for Tweet aggregations to acquisition by Google.This is fine if you own Twitter, but for the rest of us communicating via ultra-short-form social media (like Facebook status updates), it seems there is another opportunity to make money. Recently I have been following links suggested by friends for patently absurd products like the E-Cigarette and even Ranchos, an Italian high-heel wedge that perches the wearer, almost tippy-toe, on a metal horseshoe sole. Surely the future, for underemployed fashion types, is paid product placement?It would certainly be a welcome source of income to many struggling writers. As the economy contracts, more print journalists are becoming bloggers, and bloggers themselves are migrating to even shorter-form media. \"What once was a rare Champagne is now just an amiable hock,\" Madame Armfeldt laments about diminishing prospects in \"A Little Night Music.\" Speaking as an amiable hack, you're singing my life with your song, lady. \"What once was a sumptuous feast is blogs,\" she might have sung, if the character had been a journalist instead of a retired courtesan. \"No, not even blogs. Tweets.\"The E-Cigarette and Rancho plugs both came from Bryan Boy, the noted Filipino fashion blogger with a developed sense of the absurd. But what about other frock stars with some capital in their name? Perhaps you'd like know the label of the latest horse blanket that Andre Leon Talley draped over his shoulders at the Paris shows. If he Tweets \"Herm\u00e8s, darling\" into your electronic ear, it seems only fair that Herm\u00e8s should tip (let's call it a \"twip\") for the service.Actresses could be \"twipped\" for dropping the names of their plastic surgeons, like Sonia Braga modeling the new season's face lift by Dr. Luiz Victor Carneiro Jr. And wouldn't you like to know exactly what new model BlackBerry Naomi Campbell threw at her latest maid? Another fashion solution to the problem may have already been found by the New York night-life character known as \"Uncle Jimmy.\" Jimmy's signature is a scrolling LED belt buckle -- which can be programmed to repeat short messages, like a ticker -- that he wears on his hat. About five years ago he realized that turning up to clubs and P.R. parties with the name of the venue or sponsor flashing off his head was a good way to get in, and score free drinks.", "print_page": null, "word_count": 467, "document_type": "blogpost", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/the-twipping-point/", "multimedia": [], "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "name": "type_of_material", "value": "News"}], "subsection_name": null, "_id": "4fd393f88eb7c8105d8c855f", "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Ben", "rank": 1, "lastname": "WIDDICOMBE"}], "original": "By BEN WIDDICOMBE"}, "section_name": "T:Style"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "snippet": "Google Ventures, whose main objective will be to turn a profit, is expected to invest up to $100 million over the next 12 months....", "news_desk": "Business", "lead_paragraph": "Google Ventures, whose main objective will be to turn a profit, is expected to invest up to $100 million over the next 12 months.", "headline": {"main": "Google to Announce Venture Fund", "print_headline": "Google to Provide Details On Its New Venture Fund"}, "pub_date": "2009-03-31T00:00:00Z", "abstract": null, "print_page": "9", "word_count": "296", "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/technology/companies/31google.html", "multimedia": [], "keywords": [{"value": "Venture Capital", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Google Inc", "is_major": "N", "rank": "2", "name": "organizations"}], "subsection_name": "Companies", "_id": "5468fcaf38f0d8317bec06f0", "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Miguel", "lastname": "HELFT"}], "original": "By MIGUEL HELFT"}, "section_name": "Technology"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "snippet": "With the music service, which it offers nowhere else, Google is trying to gain market share....", "news_desk": "Business", "lead_paragraph": "With the music service, which it offers nowhere else, Google is trying to gain market share.", "headline": {"seo": "Google Offers Links Free Downloads in China", "main": "Google Offers Links to Free Music Downloads in China", "print_headline": "Google Offers Links to Free Music Downloads in China"}, "pub_date": "2009-03-31T00:00:00Z", "abstract": null, "print_page": "9", "word_count": "693", "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/technology/companies/31music.html", "multimedia": [{"subtype": "thumbnail", "url": "images/2009/03/31/business/31google.1.75.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2009/03/31/business/31google.1.75.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75"}, "type": "image"}], "keywords": [{"value": "Google Inc", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "China", "is_major": "N", "rank": "2", "name": "glocations"}, {"value": "Recordings and Downloads (Audio)", "is_major": "N", "rank": "3", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Computers and the Internet", "is_major": "N", "rank": "4", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Music", "is_major": "N", "rank": "5", "name": "subject"}], "subsection_name": "Companies", "_id": "5468f28438f0d8317bec060a", "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "David", "lastname": "BARBOZA"}], "original": "By DAVID BARBOZA"}, "section_name": "Technology"}], "meta": {"hits": 64}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
