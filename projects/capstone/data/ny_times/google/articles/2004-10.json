Here's how two aspiring screenwriters' pet project, more than six months in the making, went from private homage to global hoax to cease-and-desist order in just a week. MARCH 2 -- Christian Newton, an admirer of Nick Nolte, sends an e-mail message to his writing partner and fellow Nolte fan, Casey McAdams, in the voice of their hero, the rugged, hard-living star of films like ''48 Hrs.,'' ''Affliction'' and ''The Hulk.'' MARCH-MAY -- The two continue to e-mail each other as ''Nick Nolte.'' The Nolte of their imaginations often writes about the archetypal Hollywood coterie of trainers and assistants -- led by a live-in nutritionist-manservant named Manolo -- he has enlisted to handle ''the more lurid aspects of his celebrity.'' They cast their messages as fictional diary entries and promise to get together soon to discuss publishing the diary online. JUNE 19 -- Mr. Newton registers the domain name www.nicknoltediary.com, listing the nonexistent 501 Privacy Lane, Santa Monica, as his address. AUGUST -- They spend about 12 hours building the Nick Nolte's Diary site. They load some early ''test entries,'' as if the actor were getting used to using his new software: ''This system for entering my thoughts seems a mite obtuse. I have to enter a title for each day you see. Sometimes it's hard to think of only one word that sums up a day. Sometimes it's hard to think of any.'' SEPTEMBER -- Having completed about six weeks of entries, they test the site on a few friends. OCT. 13 -- Mr. Newton's co-worker Andy Baio publishes the first link to the diary on his blog, Waxy.org, at 10:10 a.m. At 1:49 p.m., the Hollywood gossip site Defamer.com discovers the diary and mentions an entry about ''Nolte's'' car accident with the actress Rosanna Arquette. (''As I gave her my attorney's card, I made a joke about celebrities never having license plates. Then I saw she indeed did have them. I felt embarrassed but I think the scene would have worked in a film.'') At 4 p.m. Jason Kottke, a prominent technology blogger, comments on Nick Nolte's choice of blogging software (Movable Type). OCT. 14 -- The number of external links is up to 18, including the Museum of Hoaxes blog, which points out that the site's registered owner, Mr. Newton, is not Nick Nolte, and that he has listed an ''obviously fake'' address. Eugene Hernandez, editor of IndieWire.com, reads the Sept. 10 entry, in which the actor gets a head rush from picking up his morning newspaper at home, and pronounces it fake: Mr. Hernandez had attended the premiere party for the film ''Clean'' with Mr. Nolte on Sept. 9 in Toronto. (The writers concede that accuracy was never their goal: ''For us, Nick was always in Malibu.'') OCT. 15 -- Google citations for ''Nick Nolte's Diary'' go over 3,000. World Entertainment News Network, a syndicated news service, reports that Mr. Nolte and Ms. Arquette were in a minor car accident; the story is picked up by dozens of radio and television stations and media outlets around the world. Yahoo! features the diary on the My Yahoo! launch page. Meanwhile, the readers of MetaFilter.com, a community blog, uncover the writers' identities, which are embedded in the diary's data feeds. OCT. 18 -- Mr. Newton and Mr. McAdams receive a cease-and-desist letter from Mr. Nolte's lawyers at Jackoway Tyerman Wertheimer Austen Mandelbaum & Morris. OCT. 19 -- Google citations reach 6,850. The home page now reads ''Not Nick Nolte's Diary'' and contains the disclaimer ''The following is a work of fiction.'' Mr. Newton and Mr. McAdams begin receiving calls from sitcom producers and literary agents.
