PLASTICS UNIT -- General Electric agreed yesterday to sell its plastics division for $11.6 billion to the largest public company in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Basic Industries Corporation known as Sabic.

And more businesses are providing these services.

[Page A1.] 9/11 INSURANCE SETTLEMENT -- Gov. Eliot Spitzer's administration announced the settlement of all insurance claims at ground zero, making $4.55 billion available for rebuilding the World Trade Center site and bringing an end to a protracted legal battle over payouts related to the 9/11 terrorist attack. [A1.] GREENSPAN SPEAKS; DOW FALLS -- The Dow Jones industrial average passed 13,600 for the first time, but shares plummeted to close at 13,525 after Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, expressed concern that China's stock market, which has recently been hitting record highs, might be in for a sharp decline. [C11.] TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CHINA -- Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. announced a limited agreement to open markets in China and develop clean coal-burning technologies. [C1.] EARLIER CONCERN ON DIABETES DRUG -- A leading diabetes doctor sent the Food and Drug Administration a letter warning of the heart risks of the drug Avandia seven years ago, and the following year the F.D.A. reprimanded GlaxoSmithKline. [C1.] JAPANESE ENGINEERS GO ABROAD -- As Japan's once-vaunted electronics industry downsizes to survive global competition, thousands of Japanese engineers and other industry professionals are going to Taiwan, South Korea and China to work at fast-growing companies that want to use Japanese technological expertise. [C1.] TARGET'S PROFIT UP 18% -- Target, the No. 2 discount chain behind Wal-Mart, said its quarterly profit rose almost 18 percent, to $651 million, or 75 cents a share, from $554 million a year earlier. The women's apparel retailer Talbots posted a better-than-expected profit. [C11.] NO CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR LAW FIRM -- Federal prosecutors said they would not file criminal charges against Sidley Austin, one of the nation's largest law firms, over its work with questionable tax shelters that helped wealthy investors evade billions of dollars in taxes. [C1.] LOTT SUPPORTS IMMIGRATION BILL -- Trent Lott, the Senate minority whip and a conservative pro-business Republican, made an all-out pitch for a comprehensive immigration bill as the Senate voted to cut the size of a proposed guest worker program, infuriating employers. [A24.] E-MAIL TO ORDINARY CELLPHONES -- You no longer need a Treo or BlackBerry to get e-mail on the move. Three new services -- from Google, Yahoo and Teleflip -- can deliver mail directly to ordinary nonsmart cellphones, free of charge, but there are compromises. State of the Art: David Pogue. [C1.] SAFETY COMMISSION NOMINEE QUITS -- Michael E. Baroody, a senior lobbyist for the National Association of Manufacturers, withdrew his nomination to head the Consumer Product Safety Commission as a growing number of senators questioned both his suitability and a $150,000 departure payment that the association was preparing to give him. [A18.] 'HI' TIMES ON MADISON AVENUE -- The latest buzzword on Madison Avenue seems to be ''hello.'' Companies as diverse as Apple, Avon, the Lincoln Financial Group and Level, a vodka brand, are using the salutation in a consumer-friendly advertising approach. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C4.] ADVANCE GAS PRICE WARNING -- A Michigan-based gas station chain is offering to send text messages to customers, giving them at least two hours' notice of impending price increases. [A22.] RISING RUPEE WORRIES INDIANS -- Concerned that the rising value of the Indian rupee may limit the country's economic growth, especially in the lucrative outsourcing industry, monetary policy experts have started putting pressure on the Reserve Bank of India to stem the rupee's rise.

Companies like Google, Microsoft and Yahoo find themselves going after the same candidates or recruiting in one another's backyards. At the same time, they are running up against a myriad of start-up companies across Silicon Valley. To lure talent, these companies have expanded their recruiting arsenal far beyond the traditional job fair to include events like technology lectures, cocktail parties, pizza parties, treasure hunts and programming contests, called ''code jams'' or ''hack days.'' [Page C1.] LOOKING FOR STARS Despite being the first and certainly the largest African-American cable channel, Black Entertainment Television has developed few of its own marketable stars and virtually no breakout programs. It relies on reruns, movies and music videos for the bulk of its lineup. The chief executive of BET, Debra L. Lee, has tried to reverse that trend, this year increasing the channel's production budget 50 percent and plunging into original programming with 16 new shows for the fall. [C1.] POLICEMAN, NOT A REPORTER David Cunningham, a prominent protester who heads the Anti-Poverty Committee in Vancouver, British Columbia, recently received a call from someone who said he was a reporter named Peter MacKay from the free daily tabloid 24 Hours Vancouver. But when Mr. Cunningham arrived outside a shopping mall for what he thought would be an interview, Peter MacKay turned out to be a plainclothes police officer who arrested him. Someone in the Vancouver Police Department thought the deception was a clever way to lure Mr. Cunningham, but the ruse provoked widespread criticism from civil rights and journalism groups. [C4.] HIGH ASPIRATIONS Though far from a household name in telecommunications, Altimo, the Russian telecommunications investment company, has aspirations of becoming a global power. But the problem it faces, some analysts say, is that at this point, Altimo has made few allies. If it is known beyond Russia at all, it is for its propensity to fight tenaciously in court and on corporate boards for its ambitions, some say. [C5.] THE MALE DIETER The face of dieting may be changing. Of the 72 million people dieting in the United States, 38 percent -- about 28 million -- are men, according to Marketdata Enterprises, a market research company. It estimates that the diet industry will be $58.7 billion this year. And NutriSystem has hired its first male spokesman, the former quarterback Dan Marino, and has started advertising in Sports Illustrated, Men's Health and ESPN magazine. [C3.] MAINSTREAM PROMOTION Mel Gibson's 2004 film ''The Passion of the Christ'' demonstrated to Hollywood just how many evangelical moviegoers there are and how much money can be made from them. Mindful of that market, Universal Pictures has teamed up with Grace Hill Media, a public relations firm that reaches out to religious groups, to publicize the mainstream film ''Evan Almighty.'' Scheduled for wide release on June 22, it stars Steve Carell as a politician who abandons Congress in order to build an ark, taking off on the story of Noah. [C3.] TALLYING GLIMPSES When the sleek yacht of the Luna Rossa team sailed away with a victory in the America's Cup semifinals, there were two vital results. The Italian crew eliminated the American team of BMW Oracle Racing with a 33-second lead. And fleeting glimpses of the flapping mainsails -- branded with logos of Telecom Italia Mobile and the broadband service Alice -- reached millions of television viewers. Those glimpses are now being counted down to the second, categorized by clear and partial visibility, tallied by major countries and then compared with the cost of traditional spot advertisements. [C2.] WEB PROPERTY DEVELOPER NameMedia, a privately held owner and developer of Web sites based in Waltham, Mass., is best seen as an online property developer, its chief executive, Kelly P. Conlin, said. Analysts suggest that NameMedia and its competitors could represent the next wave of Internet initial public offerings, while also providing a peek at a significant change in what people see when they stumble onto obscure Web properties. Bob Tedeschi, E-Commerce Report. [C5.] THE TOUCH-UP In a situation not as emotionally charged as when Time magazine darkened O.J. Simpson's mug shot on its cover a decade ago, no fewer than three magazines were reacting to claims last week that they had doctored their covers -- and one retouched celebrity even cried foul. [C4.] A PULITZER AWARD Often the writing and photography that win Pulitzer Prizes require heroic efforts. For one recipient, Jahangir Razmi , the process of receiving the award also took 27 years. In 1979, Mr. Razmi stood near executioners as they shot Kurdish prisoners in Sanandaj, Iran. One picture was picked up by the wire service United Press International. To protect Mr. Razmi, his name was never printed. But after decades of keeping silent, Mr. Razmi allowed his name to appear in a December 2006 article in The Wall Street Journal, which prompted the Pulitzer Prize Board to seek out Mr. Razmi to award him the prize in person. [C4.] VIEWER REVOLT The cancellation of the CBS series ''Jericho'' has led to a viewer revolt that has included not only the usual petition drives, but also the delivery of tons of nuts (mostly walnuts, but also peanuts and pecans) to the two responsible CBS executives. [C4.] THE PRETEEN MARKET With a faithful audience in the millions, magazines for the early teenage years are in overdrive, bolstered by last year's enthusiasm for new stars from the Disney Channel's hit ''High School Musical,'' which made household names not only of Zac Efron and Corbin Bleu, but also of Ashley Tisdale and Vanessa Anne Hudgens.
