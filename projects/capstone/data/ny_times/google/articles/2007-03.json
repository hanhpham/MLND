Mr. Racine will be succeeded by Alain Seban, until now education and culture adviser to President Jacques Chirac, who himself leaves office in May. Although Mr. Seban, 42, has no museum management experience, he appears to have benefited from the tradition that outgoing French presidents place loyal aides in significant posts before they depart. Mr. Racine, 55, a former diplomat and part-time novelist, had also not worked before in culture, but he played a crucial role in expanding the Pompidou's horizons beyond Paris: it is building an annex in Metz, a city in the northeast, and plans to open a satellite in Shanghai. At the French National Library Mr. Racine will inherit a program initiated by Mr. Jeanneney to have Europe digitize its libraries, a response to Google's program involving numerous American universities and libraries.
