Sarah Palin.I might have termed it \"artificial balance,\" but \"false equivalency\" works for me, too.For far too long we've heard \"fair and balanced\" when it could just as well have been termed \"irrelevant falsehoods mouthed by a spinmeister\" running in the same article or airing in the same broadcast as \"factual information from a candidate.\"Frankly, I'd welcome regulations requiring ads, speeches and press releases to present facts that can be verified from all political candidates, elected or appointed officeholders or chief executives.If we'd had them all along, our political landscape, our financial fortunes and our present world persona would be very different.Rita L. McKeeNew York, Sept. 21, 2008 \u25cf Reporters are not restricted to second-person reporting. Reporters are allowed to speak with their own voice. A reporter has a higher duty than a person being quoted by the reporter.People being quoted can indulge themselves in partiality. But a reporter, to maintain credibility, must attempt to report \"truthfully.\"The writer of an editorial is making a statement, which is understood to have some partiality to it. An editorial speaks with an editor's or a publisher's voice. And that voice does not have to present itself as impartial, as a reporter of facts, although it can.Jackie AldridgeAlameda, Calif., Sept. 21, 2008 \u25cf The quote attributed to The Times's executive editor, Bill Keller - \"We had to fit it into a manageable space\" - is just a defense mechanism in selective reporting to support a preconceived conclusion. Crossing the line between reporting and editorial comments in a news article leads to strengthening the decline of news reporting credibility and use of obvious distortions.Don TenerowiczEllington, Conn., Sept. 21, 2008\u25cf\u25cfRe \"Getting Past the Formalities\" (Sept. 14): It's very nice of you to admit that using Barack Obama's middle name, Hussein, three times on the front page on Aug. 28 was an \"overkill\" and that by not using John McCain's full name, John Sidney McCain III, in exactly the same situation, The Times was a tad inconsistent in its treatment of the two candidates.But are you certain of the reasons Mr. McCain's name was abbreviated where Mr. Obama's was not? Are you sure that it wasn't because Mr. McCain \"prefers\" to forget both Sidney and (even more) the fact that he's the third of the line? Or that by omitting it, The Times wasn't bowing to Mr. McCain's preferences?The Times has seemed to be heavily invested in the earth-moving business: make every molehill about Mr. Obama into a mountain and vice versa.Tamara P. DuvallLexington, Va., Sept. 14, 2008 \u25cf It's funny, a few months ago I had been reading The Times and had noticed, somewhat irritably, the use of \"Mrs.\" when referring to Hillary Clinton. I love the newspaper and trust it implicitly (this might not exactly be a good thing), but I was put off by the decision not to use the more P.C. \"Ms.\"Then I was annoyed when I noticed \"Ms. Palin,\" feeling that such considerations were wasted on someone so terrifying and - well, all those adjectives you want to use on her.I'm glad you answered this for me. If you hadn't addressed it, I doubt I would ever have had any clarification on this issue and maybe unfairly judged the paper's editors.Brianna SnyderSpringfield, Mass., Sept. 15, 2008\u25cf\u25cfRe \"The Scrutiny of Sarah Palin\" (Sept. 7): The Times has been absolutely correct in its scrutiny of Gov. Sarah Palin.After inflating Ms. Palin's family leadership role and small-town values into legitimate qualifications for the vice presidency, the McCain camp is now claiming that anyone who examines these areas has violated her family's privacy.The Times needs to look even deeper into Ms. Palin's scant record. The possibility that this woman might wield power over the entire country is terrifying.Thea AndersonLincoln, Mass., Sept. 8, 2008 \u25cf I don't buy your column.The coverage The Times has provided of Gov. Sarah Palin has been biased.It's O.K. to be biased. We all are, to some degree.What is not O.K. is when The Times refuses to admit it, or recognize it.Phil GrimmRogue River, Ore., Sept. 8, 2008 \u25cf The Times's coverage of Gov. Sarah Palin has been absolutely fair and totally needed.We are not living in the Joe McCarthy era of fear or the George W. Bush era of lies anymore. After The Times was initially hoodwinked by President Bush's invasion of Iraq, it vowed it would never shy away from investigating issues and getting to the truth of the matter.The Times vetted Barack Obama and now it is vetting Ms. Palin.This is a crucial election, so please, Times, continue to dig deep and report your findings accurately. We voters can handle the truth.Kathy BergerSan Anselmo, Calif., Sept. 8, 2008 \u25cf I concur with your take on unjustified Republican complaints about the scrutiny of Gov. Sarah Palin. Vice-presidential candidates are not vetted by the voters, so unless these candidates have visible public records, such as that of Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., we are left to rely on what is released by campaign operatives - not the most reliable sources.Thus it is left to mainstream journalists to pose the serious questions about the candidates. In this case, the G.O.P. is merely seeking to embellish a paper-thin public record and head off potentially embarrassing questions.Had the McCain campaign properly investigated Ms. Palin, it would not be playing catch-up on this matter.Vaughn A. CarneyStowe, Vt., Sept. 8, 2008 \u25cf It is clear that the press must be even more vigilant in its job this political season.With Steve Schmidt in charge of the McCain campaign and his mentor, Karl Rove, manning a commentator's desk at Fox News, the people of American need to know more than ever who is spinning out the information contained in news stories.More often then not we see campaign and commentator remarks cut and pasted into news stories without attribution (such as Sarah Palin's claim that she said, \"Thanks but no thanks on that Bridge to Nowhere\") without providing the evidence to prove their veracity.Now more than ever, it is up to the press in our free and democratic society to root out the use of the press for political gain (propaganda). Don't let Mr. Rove and his disciples use the press to sell Ms. Palin and John McCain the same way they used the press to sell the Iraq war.Debra HollowayRye, N.H., Sept. 8, 2008 \u25cf Thank you to The Times for its continued efforts to give a whole picture of who Gov. Sarah Palin is. I hadn't realized how much the paper had already done.I appreciate your straightforward response about all of the recent criticism of The Times. At the moment there is nothing more important than informing the public before the election.In Ms. Palin we seem to have a hard-working, hard-hitting lady with some decent accomplishments and with exceptional looks (this is worthy of mention, as it seems to capture the imagination of the electorate). But there has been considerable stretching of the truth. She is in absolutely no way prepared to move into a position of power any greater than she presently has.I see many danger signs and can only hope (and expect) that The Times will continue the journalism we're seeing in regard to the vetting process.D. MandellSeattle, Sept. 7, 2008 \u25cf The Times is investigating Sarah Palin in order to analyze her judgment, understanding, persuasiveness to skeptics, contacts and other attributes necessary for success in the vice presidency and, potentially, the presidency.Attempting to undermine this investigation creates a reasonable inference of a motive to conceal.The honor of the investigative reporters of The Times needs no defending. At times, it is the judgment of editors that has come into question. There is no journalistic need to defend the reports of the investigation - its accuracy speaks for itself.But as a letter writer has asked, where is The Times in reporting whether the stated goals of the people running for the presidency and the vice presidency would allow them faithfully to carry out the oath of office to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed\"?Robert LiebrossWestbury, N.Y., Sept. 7, 2008 \u25cf The response to the bashing of Gov. Sarah Palin in the news media always seems to be, \"We have a duty to ask questions,\" and then to add that Republicans don't like to be questioned.Reports on FactCheck.org, a University of Pennsylvania program, show that many of the \"questions\" the media are asking are lightly veiled attacks, often containing false accusations. There are hundreds of reporters asking similar \"questions.\" This is why people see such a powerful bias in much of the media.For example, CNN, in an interview on Sept. 4 with a senior adviser to the McCain campaign, asked how much of a problem it would be that Ms. Palin had significantly cut the budget in Alaska for special needs children. The reporter said she had been getting \"a lot of e-mails about the subject.\" But in fact, as FactCheck.org notes, Ms. Palin increased funding for special education dramatically.CNN could have spent less than five minutes in a Google search to know that the \"question\" was a false accusation.The news media does not start questions to Barack Obama with \"How does a radical Muslim terrorist like you expect to be able to attract American voters?\" But reporters don't hesitate to ask such questions of Republicans.Joe DennyWayne, Pa., Sept. 9, 2008 \u25cf Thank you to The Times for printing stories about Gov. Sarah Palin and for continuing to look into her record and positions. I want to know as much as possible before Election Day! I don't really get the people who think this should be off limits.Please don't let up. I especially appreciated the extremely informative article about the vetting process.Jen BinghamIndianapolis, Sept. 8, 2008 \u25cfYou provide an excellent defense of what should not have to be defended - journalists digging into the reality behind a campaign's spin.It's a shame that the McCain team has forced the news media to work overtime to compensate for its clearly sloppy vetting of its vice-presidential pick.I commend The Times for writing anything newsworthy that it finds out about a woman who is unknown to the American public but who has vaulted to celebrity status for the most superficial of reasons - her image.The woman could well be making executive decisions affecting all our lives. She has so far shown herself to be completely ill equipped to do so. It's the responsibility of all media to ignore appearances and get to the facts that will reveal the substance of this woman.Patty GrossmanBrooklyn, Sept. 7, 2008", "headline": {"main": "Letters: Making it Airtight, Formalities and Scrutiny", "kicker": "The Public Editor's Journal"}, "pub_date": "2008-09-27T11:26:17Z", "abstract": "Re \"Make It Airtight\" (Sept. 21): I was gratified to read that Richard Stevenson, the editor who directs The Times's coverage of the election, said that \"we don't want to fall into the trap of false equivalency\" when accurately reporting the false and misleading advertising, speeches and statements employed by Senator John McCain and his [...]", "print_page": null, "word_count": 1814, "document_type": "blogpost", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "https://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/letters-making-it-airtight-formalities-and-scrutiny/", "multimedia": [], "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "name": "type_of_material", "value": "News"}], "subsection_name": null, "_id": "4fd391bf8eb7c8105d8c2e7e", "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Clark", "rank": 1, "lastname": "HOYT"}], "original": "By CLARK HOYT"}, "section_name": "Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "Blog", "snippet": "Google's new One Box feature is yet another reason to skip a site's internal search features....", "news_desk": null, "lead_paragraph": "Last week on this blog, I wrote about some cool developments in Google's search feature.
