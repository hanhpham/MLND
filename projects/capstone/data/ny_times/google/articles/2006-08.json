(BET) DON'T TRIP . . . HE AIN'T THROUGH WITH ME YET! -- Mr. Zoot Suit, the comedian Steve Harvey (above), keeps it clean as he revels in faith, family, preachers and relationships in this stand-up routine taped before church folk at Bishop T. D. Jakes's MegaFest, a four-day evangelical festival in Atlanta. Listen up: underneath the laugh lines lurk words of wisdom. 8 P.M. (Showtime) DIARY OF A MAD BLACK WOMAN (2005). Hell hath no fury, especially when Madea is working on behalf of the scorned. In this adaptation of his revenge play about a woman whose husband of 18 years boots her out of their mansion, Tyler Perry revs up his gun-packing, extra-extra- large grandmother, whose idea of dividing community property requires a chain saw. 9 P.M. (Discovery) DIRTY JOBS: JOBS THAT BITE . . . HARDER -- Mike Rowe mingles with people who earn their livings working with toothy terrors, including some that make plaster molds of live sharks for fiberglass replicas and others who make shark-proof diving suits. Problem is, it's his turn to test the things. (Cue the ''Jaws'' theme.) 9 P.M. (13) BILL MOYERS ON FAITH AND REASON -- Why does an elementary teacher reared in New York and schooled at Miss Porter's and Berkeley decide to become a Buddhist nun? Tonight, in this series' eighth and last installment, Pema Chodron (above right) talks with Mr. Moyers about the spiritual search that led her to this ancient Eastern practice, and why more and more harried Westerners are turning to it in an effort to slow down. 9 P.M.

(USA) MONK -- Natalie persuades Monk to go into business as a private eye, but his first case, a fender bender, is no mere bump in the road. 9 P.M. (BBC America) EDDIE IZZARD: GLORIOUS -- No topic is off-limits in this taping from Mr. Izzard's 1997 stand-up tour, in which he sputters and spews out one-liners like a human equivalent of Google. His riff on air terror, in which the evildoer is a cookie-snatching pilot, may not hit the same comic heights these days. But if you're not laughing with Mr. Izzard (above), you'll be laughing at him, or at least his get-up: shiny apple-red suit, frosted shag and glittery fingernails. 10 P.M.

[C1.] EXPECTING A PAUSE -- After a string of 17 consecutive interest rate increases, the Federal Reserve may pause this week in its long campaign of monetary tightening, which has lifted the benchmark federal funds rate to 5.25 percent, from 1 percent in June 2004. At least that is what most investors have come to believe. [C1.] CLERKS ON THE WEB -- Internet retailers are increasingly adding online chat specialists who lurk in the background and wait for signs that someone needs just the slightest nudge to buy an item. Paco Underhill, right, a retailing consultant, said: ''Making this process social is important, because the acquisition of goods has never been just about the acquisition of goods. There's always been a social element to it.'' Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. [C9.] GOOGLE AD DEAL -- Google has struck a deal to allow Web site owners to put video clips from Viacom, including ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' and MTV's ''Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County,'' on their pages. The clips will be accompanied by advertising, with Viacom, Google and site owners dividing ad revenue. [C1.] THE FADING PICTURE TUBE -- The bulky, squarish, heavy picture tube is heading for the dustbin of history much faster than anyone expected. This year, the number of TV models in the United States that use glass cathode-ray tubes to produce an image has been reduced sharply. By next year, even fewer C.R.T. televisions will be made, and fewer retailers will sell them. [C1.] MOVIE MARKETING, TRANSLATED -- As Hollywood increasingly looks overseas to bolster the bottom line, studios are finding that the rules that apply to movie marketing and distribution in the United States -- calling for a barrage of talk-show interviews and television advertising -- do not necessarily translate in Hamburg, Tokyo or Moscow.

[C4.] FREE PAPERS IN EUROPE -- When Metro International, a publisher of free newspapers, moved into France four years ago, established competitors cried foul.

And publishers of existing papers, casting about for any way to retain readers, are increasingly turning to giveaways. [C6.] SATIRE STARTS A FEUD -- A satire in a German newspaper aimed at the twin brothers who now head the Polish government has sparked a cross-border feud over the role of the press. [C6.] AD MAKEOVER AT MONTBLANC -- Montblanc is paying up-and-coming designers to put their names, and their clothing, on a new crop of ads appearing in the September issue of Vogue. It is a May-December relationship, in which Montblanc, the venerable company famed for its high-end pens, will share glossy ad space with youthful designers whose mere presence adds an element of cool.

In Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes killed at least 16 people, according to Lebanese officials. A1 Efforts to speed adoption of a draft resolution to halt the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah faltered at the United Nations while sharp criticism of the measure rang out across the Middle East. The Security Council, despite enormous pressure to take action in a war that has raged unchecked for 26 days, failed to hold an expected meeting to discuss the measure and schedule a vote.

Resolution During a news conference, Ali Larijani, Iran's security chief and top nuclear negotiator, said that Iran would defy the United Nations Security Council by refusing to halt its enrichment of uranium by the end of August.

A3 Hong Kong Surveillance Bill Pro-Beijing lawmakers approved legislation that gives broad authority to the police to conduct covert surveillance, including wiretapping phones, bugging homes and offices and monitoring e-mail. The bill passed the 60-member Legislative Council on a vote of 32-0 after pro-democracy lawmakers walked out of the chamber in protest. A4 Mexican Vows More Protests The presidential candidate Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador vowed that the daily demonstrations supporting his demand for a full recount of the results in last month's presidential race would convene at the courthouse where a special electoral court had denied his request. A3 NATIONAL A10-13 States Expand Rights Of Victims on Self-Defense In the last year, 15 states have enacted laws that expand the right of self-defense, allowing crime victims to use deadly force in situations that might formerly have subjected them to prosecution for murder. The first of the new laws, which served as a model for the others, took effect in Florida in October. A1 Routine Duty on the Border For the National Guard troops sent to the United States-Mexican border, their jobs may seem humdrum, but the Border Patrol has claimed some early success as the operation moves into full swing. Critics still question whether the Guard troops are making a big difference. A10 Immigration Hearings Criticized When House leaders announced their plan to hold 21 immigration hearings in 13 states, they said it demonstrated a commitment to securing the border. But some lawmakers said the schedule of the hearings only heightened their concerns that the Republican leadership was using immigration as a political weapon.

A10 Nashville Murder Trial Starts Perry March, 45, goes on trial, accused of murdering his wife, whose remains have not been found.

A12 Local Issues in Montana Race Jon Tester, left, a 49-year-old farmer and Democratic state senator, in his first run at statewide office, is trying to unseat Senator Conrad Burns in Montana. The nationally watched election a few months ago seemed to be swinging on the issue of Washington's ways and mores, but has now downshifted to local, idiosyncratic Montana issues. A13 SPORTSMONDAY D1-7 Woods Wins Buick Open Tiger Woods notched the 50th victory of his career, defeating Jim Furyk by three strokes at the Buick Open and finding new ways to build on a reputation that is looming over golf once again. Mr. Woods finished the tournament at 24-under par 264. D1 N.F.L. Owners to Select Boss With the 32 National Football League owners meeting in Chicago to select the next commissioner, almost everyone is willing to predict who will get the job.

D2 NEW YORK/REGION B1-7 Muslims in U.S. Struggle After Serving in Iraq For Muslim Americans who serve in the United States armed forces the trip home from Iraq has been especially fraught. They were called upon to fight a Muslim enemy alongside comrades who sometimes questioned their loyalty, and then returned home to neighborhoods where the occupation is dismissed as an imperialist crusade. A1 Lieberman Confronts Critics Senator Joseph I. Lieberman confronted the anger roiling the Democratic Party over Iraq, in an attempt to explain his support for the war and to win back doubting voters in Connecticut before the state primary election tomorrow.

The University of California has 100 libraries on 10 campuses. The university system has already started digitizing some of its own collections, so Google's efforts will be complementary, said Adam Smith, group business product manager for Google Search. The University of California libraries join other Google library partners, including the University of Michigan, Harvard, Stanford, the New York Public Library, Oxford University and the Library of Congress. Google is not paying the University of California system for the right to scan its books. Mr. Smith said Google planned to make available the full texts of all public domain titles that it scans, but that for books still in copyright, it would provide only ''short snippets or bibliographic information.'' Google's plans have been the subject of controversy in the publishing industry, and the company has been sued by several publishers and authors who are challenging Google's right to scan books that are still under copyright. Mr. Smith said Google believed its use of small portions of the books was ''consistent with the fair use'' laws that permit the replication of copyrighted material.

[C1.] STOCKS RISE ON PRICE DATA Wall Street rallied after a government report showing inflation softening at the wholesale level encouraged hopes among investors that the Federal Reserve may be able to avoid further interest rate increases. [C1.] THE SCIENCE OF BATTERIES In trying to improve the endurance of batteries, scientists cannot overcome some basic hurdles of chemistry and physics. The more energy that is stored in a smaller package, the more volatile and dangerous that package becomes. The volatility of some batteries became clear with Dell's recall of 4.1 million laptop batteries. Dell said the batteries, made by Sony, could catch fire. [C1.] BAE'S GROWTH PLANS BAE, the British military contractor, says it is neither British nor American, but a new breed of military contractor -- a trans-Atlantic supplier. The chief executive has even hinted he might move the company to the United States if he gets more Pentagon business, a goal that is central to his strategy for growth. [C1.] AIR DELAYS CONTINUE Passengers flying out of Heathrow Airport in London endured a sixth day of disruption as airlines weighed the possibility of seeking compensation from the airport operator and the British government, in an attempt to avoid passing costs on to customers. [C8.] AIRPORT OPERATOR CRITICIZED BAA, the British airport operator, faced continued criticism for its handling of new security procedures, with passengers and airline executives asking why the company did not hire temporary workers to meet the demand for security checks. [C8.] MEDICARE DRUG PREMIUMS Federal officials announced that the average premium for Medicare prescription drug coverage next year would be about $24 a month, which is the same as this year and 40 percent less than originally estimated for 2007. [A12.] TRADE WITH VENEZUELA Even as the talk from Caracas and Washington grows more hostile and the countries seem to be growing ever farther apart, trade between Venezuela and the United States has reached its highest level ever. [A3.] MONSANTO MAKES ACQUISITION Monsanto will acquire the Delta and Pine Land Company, the nation's leading supplier of cotton seeds, in a move that will add to Monsanto's commanding position in the business of biotechnology crops. [C4.] UNAPPROVED PLANT FOUND An unapproved type of genetically engineered grass has been found in the wild in what scientists say could be the first instance in America in which a biotechnology plant has established itself outside a farm. [A13.] JOCKEYING FOR NICKEL MINER The three-way scramble continued among companies trying to acquire Inco, the nickel miner based in Toronto. [C8.] WAL-MART EARNINGS FALL Wal-Mart Stores reported its first decline in quarterly income in 10 years, blaming the financial slip on troubles in foreign markets. [C3.] CHANGES AT PFIZER Less than three weeks after being named Pfizer's chief executive, Jeffrey B. Kindler moved to put his stamp on the drug maker with a wide-ranging executive reorganization. [C3.] EX-CHIEF DECLARED A FUGITIVE The hunt for Jacob Alexander, former chief executive of Comverse, was stepped up after the Federal Bureau of Investigation declared him a fugitive and said agents were seeking his arrest. Mr. Alexander was charged last week with conspiracy to commit securities fraud. [C3.] MAKING THE CASE FOR G.E. Late last month, an array of General Electric executives stood before about 100 analysts and attempted to prove that all of G.E.'s wildly disparate units march to the same tune. In a sense, G.E. was preaching to the choir, with most analysts covering G.E. rating its shares a buy. But investors are not heeding the advice. For more than a year, analysts have predicted that the stock would reach $40 or more. Instead, it has hovered around the mid-30's. [C5.] FOOD SITE WITH ATTITUDE Chow.com, a new food Web site, hopes to inject a hip sensibility into its smorgasbord of recipes, restaurant reviews, party hints, video tutorials and coverage of the marketing and culture of food. All this is aimed at a younger audience than the major food Web sites tend to attract. [F1.] GOOGLE'S WIRELESS PLANS Even as it rolls out a local wireless Internet service in the city where it is based, Google says it has no plans to position itself as a national provider of such services.

Business Briefing An article on these developments is at nytimes.com/business. STAPLES, THE OFFICE SUPPLIES RETAILER, said that its profit rose 19 percent in the second quarter, driven by market share gains in North America and strong back-to-school sales.

Yet if you ask economists and other academics that study the movie industry, Mr. Redstone's decision was, in financial terms, spot on. [C1.] COLLEGIATE WEB EFFORTS -- Sears Holdings is among the retailers putting extra effort this year into attracting college students online. With a new Web site, Sears is hoping to take advantage of an untapped market, said Lorna Sargent, above, director of e-commerce content.
