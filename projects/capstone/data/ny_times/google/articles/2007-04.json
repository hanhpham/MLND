While the increase of American troops plays out in Baghdad, Baquba has emerged as a magnet for insurgents from around the country. A1 At least 34 people were killed in Baghdad in another day punctuated by car bombings and suicide vest attacks on civilian targets of the kind that the two-month-old American security crackdown has so far been unable to restrain. A8 Russia Lifts Bear Hunting Ban For the first time in more than five decades, the Russian government is preparing to allow hunters to kill polar bears, which are descending with greater regularity on coastal villages in parts of the far north as a result of shrinking sea ice generally attributed to a warming planet.

A1 Georgia Prosecutor Unyielding When North Carolina's attorney general said an overreaching prosecutor lacked evidence to support charges of rape against three Duke University lacrosse players, some in Georgia hoped his pronouncement would help free a former star high school football player serving 10 years without parole for having consensual oral sex with a 15-year-old girl, even though he was 17 at the time. A12 Lobster Season in Distress Although spring is traditionally when lobster prices are highest, lobsters have rarely been as scarce or expensive as they have been in the last few weeks, thanks to a confluence of bad weather, extremely cold water and a lack of reserve supply.
