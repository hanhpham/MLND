Tainted tap water, unsafe for contact with skin. Entire neighborhoods of empty, moldy houses, waiting for that bulldozer's first punch. This is the scene in New Orleans a month after the deluge. A19 Animals Take Over Highway There are no people along highway 27 between Cameron, La., and Lake Charles after 6 p.m. In their stead are animals, whose dusk-time proclivity for sauntering brazenly into the two-lane road has contributed to the strict curfew that comes a few hours earlier than those observed an hour to the west.

Jobs, the company's co-founder and chief executive, was back last week to introduce an iPod that can play video. Behind the News -- The bells and whistles of an Apple product unveiling are never to be ignored, but this time it was wedding bells: iPod and television are the happy couple. The new device can shop online for episodes from some ABC and Disney Channel shows, including from the night before, for about $2 a pop. The move comes after two years of Mr. Jobs's saying that nobody would watch a movie on a two-inch screen. TO BOSTON WE GO The News -- JetBlue said Tuesday that next month it would introduce 10 daily flights between New York and Boston. Behind the News -- It's the kind of airfare that could almost make a Yankee fan want to go into enemy territory: $25 one way, for tickets bought by this Thursday. Thereafter the flight will cost $40 to $120. But the route has long been dominated by the traditional major carriers, and they were not without an answer for JetBlue's latest nudging onto their turf. The next day American Airlines began offering $25 tickets on the same route, and Delta introduced a $40 fare. Take that, rookie. THE FOOT-WIDE JOURNAL The News -- The Wall Street Journal plans to shrink by about the width of the 'Street' in its banner. Behind the News -- The measure comes on the heels of The Journal's plan to shrink its international edition to tabloid size, starting next month. Both moves are in part a response to the increase in the cost of newsprint, an industrywide concern that has led other papers to similar decisions. Making The Journal smaller is expected to save its owner, Dow Jones, about $18 million a year. The company has said that it expected the smaller size to be more appealing to readers. ANOTHER GOOD THING? The News -- Martha Stewart is taking on a new partner, the housing developer KB Homes. The deal calls for a subdivision in Cary, N.C., to incorporate the style of Ms. Stewart's own homes into its 650 houses. Behind the News -- Before anyone who wants to live like Martha packs up the free-range chickens and heads to Cary, there are one or two questions to consider: one, is the housing industry heading into a downturn, and two, is Ms. Stewart's company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, whose stock has fallen since March, diluting its brand as it branches into areas like satellite radio and music producing? YOU'VE GOT AOL! The News -- AOL.com has positioned itself as a free Web portal in recent months, with much of the content that used to be available only to subscribers now open to everyone.

Behind the News -- The paying user continues to flee AOL, but Web sites that are part of it -- Moviefone, Mapquest, Netscape -- are a draw. That appeal may be behind talks between Time Warner and others regarding potential investments in AOL.

The lawsuit is similar to one filed last month by three authors whose works are included in the University of Michigan library, one of the libraries whose collections Google plans to digitize. By filing a similar suit, the publishers put considerably more muscle behind the action against Google. Google has maintained that its program is covered by the fair use provision of copyright law and that it therefore does not need permission of the copyright holders for the library project. The program makes only small portions of a copyrighted text available to users online; Google likens the result to an electronic card catalog.

(AP) Profits Decline at Archer Daniels Midland Shares of the Archer Daniels Midland Company rose yesterday despite a 30 percent decline in first-quarter earnings from sluggish grain sales because of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Much of the profit decline was attributed to the agricultural services unit, which was disrupted by the storms. The largest business segments, including corn and oilseed processing, showed solid profit growth. Net income was $186.3 million, or 29 cents a share, compared with $266.3 million, or 41 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had expected 33 cents a share. Sales dropped 4 percent, to $8.63 billion, below analysts' estimates of $9.08 billion.

Mr. Bresnan, 50, who is an associate enforcement director in Washington, will oversee staffing issues like assignments.

Sales were unchanged at 2.2 trillion yen ($19 billion).

Kiyosaki's financial literacy manifesto and a look back at the bestseller lists from 1955....", "news_desk": "Book Review Desk", "lead_paragraph": "FATHER KNOWS BEST: Robert T. Kiyosaki's financial literacy manifesto, ''Rich Dad, Poor Dad'' is No. 4 on this week's paperback advice list. First published in 1997, this thing has now been on the list for 260 weeks -- longer than all but a handful of titles, including ''The Road Less Traveled'' (694 weeks) and ''The Joy of Sex (363 weeks). Kiyosaki, who was born in Hawaii, has diversified feverishly in the years since ''Rich Dad'' was released -- there are now 10 books in the ''Rich Dad'' series, he's done infomercials, been on ''Oprah'' and played Madison Square Garden. Kiyosaki's book is often credited with helping start the boom in ''flipping'' real estate, but as Carol Lloyd pointed out recently in The San Francisco Chronicle, he's backing off some of that advice now. ''I'm worried about people using their houses as A.T.M. machines,'' he said. He added that flipping is ''really stupid right now.'' (These days, he is more bullish on oil and gold.) Kiyosaki's kind of success can bring scrutiny. When I punched his name into Google, for example, the top hit was a strenuous, almost book-length put-down of ''Rich Dad, Poor Dad'' by the newsletter publisher John T. Reed. (Reed doesn't call Kiyosaki ''the worst financial guru of my generation,'' but he comes close.) Still, as Kiyosaki said on CNN earlier this year: ''The world is full of critics, and I ask those critics, 'Have you sold 20 million copies of a book so far? Are you a multimillionaire?' '' BACK PAGES: Fifty years ago this week, in the Oct. 16, 1955, issue of the Book Review, Herman Wouk had the No. 1 place on the fiction list with ''Marjorie Morningstar.'' Wouk's novel had been the main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club, and it was reviewed on the Book Review's cover. (The critic Maxwell Geismar wrote about it here, and frostily. He called it ''very good reading indeed,'' but added: ''The values of true culture are as remote from its polished orbit as are, at base, the impulses of real life.'') Rounding out the top five positions on the fiction list were Patrick Dennis's ''Auntie Mame,'' Sloan Wilson's ''Man in the Gray Flannel Suit,'' Robert Ruark's ''Something of Value'' and Francoise Sagan's ''Bonjour Tristesse.'' Sagan's novel was reviewed in these pages by the French writer Marcel Arland, who likened it to ''a cocktail -- as smooth and stimulating, and as complicated as you could wish from a young girl.'' (The ingredients of Sagan's fizzy mix, Arland wrote, were ''a piquant situation . . . a little perversity, a dash of false candor'' and ''a tinge of involuntary frankness.'') On the nonfiction list, Anne Morrow Lindbergh's ''Gift From the Sea'' was at No. 1, followed by Norman Vincent Peale's ''Power of Positive Thinking,'' John A. Schindler's ''How to Live 365 Days a Year,'' Edward Steichen's ''Family of Man'' and Catherine Marshall's ''Man Called Peter.''
