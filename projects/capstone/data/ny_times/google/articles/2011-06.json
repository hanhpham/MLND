The museum, which purchased the painting in 1941, posted an image of it online in 2000 amid concerns about its provenance; in 2004 it was contacted by Fred Westfield, a nephew of the art dealer. Mr. Westfield, a retired economics professor in Tennessee, learned about the painting from a Google search. The Globe said that the museum had in recent years returned other works stolen during World War II. It also fought a legal battle to keep the Oskar Kokoschka painting ''Two Nudes (Lovers)''; a federal appeals court ruled last year that it was the rightful owner of this work.
