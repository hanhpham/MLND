They designed it as a split-level terrace overlooking the park's lake, with an underground arcade whose ceiling was composed of almost 16,000 tiles. Over the decades, the 50-ton ceiling weakened and its tiles deteriorated. The tiles have been in storage since being removed in the 1980s during an initial repair effort. The Central Park Conservancy renewed its plan for a $7 million restoration after getting a $3.5 million gift from the estate of Evelyn West in 2002. The arcade, originally completed in the 1860s, is expected to reopen in late January. HAEYOUN PARK AND GRAHAM ROBERTS Tile Restoration CLEANING AND REPAIRING Conservators have spent the last two years cleaning all 15,876 tiles, reattaching broken segments and repainting the tiles to match their original colors. REPLACING DAMAGE About 10 percent of the tiles were beyond repair. New ones were made in Stokeon-Trent, England, for $250 to $270 each. REINSTALLING TILE PANELS The 49 panels alternate between two patterns. Three panels, consisting only of brand new tiles, will be placed in one of the two side loggias. New Layers Of Support UPPER TERRACE A new waterproof membrane will catch water leaking through the pavement and redirect it to a subsurface drain before it reaches the ceiling tiles. STEEL SUPPORTS Brick arches have been replaced by steel beams, which, together with the existing wrought iron girders, will act as the primary support for the road above. CAST IRON RIBS The ornamental cast iron framework was painted a shade of gold with mica powder for extra sheen, accented by blue and reddish brown. Not much is known about the framework's historic colors other than that they were ''richly gilded.'' TILE PANELS Tiles on each panel are fused with mortar, then screwed into a metal frame so they can be installed into the cast iron ribs as a single unit. Each panel has 324 encaustic, or inlaid, tiles. They were made using small pieces of colored clay laid into a mold and baked together so that the colors are embedded, not just a surface glaze. Diagrams highlight the aforementioned items.

Silicon Valley is filled with start-ups whose main business proposition is to be bought by Google, or for that matter by Yahoo or Microsoft. Countless other start-ups rely on Google as their primary driver of traffic or on Google's powerful advertising system as their primary source of income. [C1.] DO-IT-YOURSELF SEARCH ENGINE -- The voluntary collaborative ''wiki'' model, which was marshaled to create the behemoth online encyclopedia Wikipedia, is being recruited to build a better search engine. [C5.] STRUGGLES FOR SATELLITE RADIO -- Last year's debut of Howard Stern's radio show on Sirius Satellite Radio put the technology on the map. But stock of Sirius and its larger rival, XM Satellite Radio, have taken a battering from Wall Street, with share prices for both off about 50 percent from their year-ago levels. Now, the two companies may be considering an attempt to merge. [C1.] WHO RUNS THE MOUSE'S WEB SITE? -- Robert A. Iger, chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, is expected to unveil next week the new Disney.com Web site, which has taken more than a year to redesign. Revamping Disney.com has been a top priority as Mr. Iger seeks to extend the Disney brand by embracing new digital media. But he may be facing an equally pressing issue: Who within Disney should be running the company's Internet properties?

[C4.] DEADLY YEAR FOR NEWS MEDIA -- The year 2006 was the deadliest for journalists and media workers worldwide, with at least 155 killings and unexplained deaths, the International Federation of Journalists announced.

A1 The list of American military fatalities in Iraq has reached the milestone of 3,000 deaths since the March 2003 invasion. The number reflects how much more dangerous a soldier's job in Iraq has become in the face of a growing and increasingly sophisticated insurgency. Violence in the country is at a high, according to the Pentagon. A1 Confronted with a second, unofficial, and more graphic video account of the execution of Saddam Hussein, executives at television news organizations made a series of what one executive called ''delicate editorial decisions'' about what they would put on the air to augment the first pictures of the execution.

A6 NATIONAL A8-16 Democrats to Propose New Ethics Rules The Democrats taking over Congress are promising sweeping changes to ethics and lobbying laws, pledging to clean up after a spate of corruption scandals under Republican rule. So far, however, their proposals are not as comprehensive as changes already adopted by many state legislatures. A1 River Restoration Effort In one of the largest river restoration efforts in the West, water is again flowing along a 62-mile stretch of the Owens River after a nearly century-long dry spell. That part of the river had been left mostly drained when upstream water, fed by snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada, was channeled 233 miles to Los Angeles. A1 Overcrowding in Madison Madison, Wis., a college town that sought to reverse the decline of its downtown in the 1980s and 90s to draw people at night and on weekends, is now facing overcrowding on the streets, vandalism and, most significantly, the police say, alcohol-related crime. Officials are now grappling with how to scale down downtown. A15 Higher Pay Sought for Judiciary Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. made judicial pay the sole topic of his second annual report, declaring that the failure by Congress to raise federal judges' salaries in recent years has become a ''constitutional crisis'' that puts the future of the federal courts in jeopardy. A14 Thousands Honor Ford Thousands of mourners filed past the coffin of former President Gerald R. Ford as he lay in state below the Capitol dome, many saying they came to pay overdue respect to an overshadowed leader.

B1 Snowless December a Rarity The National Weather Service said that last month appeared to be the first December without a snowflake in Central Park since Rutherford B. Hayes was president. B2 Park Project Nearly Done Calvert Vaux's original plans for Central Park called for a split-level terrace overlooking the lake.
