I've always traveled with friends or girlfriends who need to see everything, who really need to digest the destination. I found it all too tiring, because New York is so exhausting every day. I always fantasized about going somewhere where I could sit alone. So I did a lot of sitting in Dominica. At the springs, bamboo pipes channel the hot water from the side of the mountain into the cast-iron tubs. All the bathtubs are vintage -- probably not a word they use in Dominica -- but they're really ancient, I would imagine from old plantation homes or other old-style homes.
