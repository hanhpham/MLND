''I'm interested in exploring areas like the back of business cards and ceilings -- why are they left empty?'' says the renegade graphic designer, who is currently working as creative director of Google's branding and marketing unit, the Creative Lab. To fill the void above, Lee creates miniature upside-down interiors that he calls ''parallel worlds,'' placing them on domestic ceilings (on commission) and corporate offices (on the sly). ''Decorating ceilings was a common art form that somehow got lost through the reductionism of modernism,'' he says. The Lilliputian lairs are meticulously furnished with objects that tell a story about the ''room'' and its imaginary owner. One installation shows the apartment of a rocker, complete with a guitar, amp, microphone and Jimi Hendrix poster. Another, installed in a home with two small children, features a petit bourgeois living room with velvet sofas and tiny glass cabinets filled with strange furry objects made of cat hair. ''The kids love it,'' Lee says. ''That's the greatest compliment.'' Go to pleaseenjoy.com.
