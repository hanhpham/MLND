Despite the company's growing Web sales, Mr. Braverman never liked its domain name, Nutsonline.com, which he'd bought in 1999. Last fall, he decided to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy a new name, Nuts.com, from a squatter. And on January 6, after the holiday season, he filed a change-of-address form and reopened on the new site. But despite high hopes and careful planning, the site's traffic took a dive, especially in terms of organic search traffic. The site, which had been averaging more than 30,000 visits each week from non-paid Google searches, saw its non-paid traffic fall 70 percent two weeks after the switch. Almost three months later, it was still down more than 50 percent.
