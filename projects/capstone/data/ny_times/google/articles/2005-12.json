The debate features a cast that includes disaster victims, coastal engineers, mortgage lenders, the insurance industry, as well as local, state and federal officials. A1 Tackling Medicaid Costs Members of Congress will soon plunge into battle over the future of Medicaid, as House and Senate negotiators try to resolve huge differences over legislation that would allow states to cut benefits and increase charges for millions of low-income people, including many children.

Much of it was driven by the time of year, as corporate chiefs and government officials scrambled to tidy up things before the new year. A MOGUL IS BORN -- Ending a succession story that was never much of a mystery, Time Warner named Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the head of its movie and television businesses, as its president and chief operating officer. The promotion makes him heir apparent to the chairman and chief executive, Richard D. Parsons. Mr. Bewkes, 53, was one of two lieutenants to Mr. Parsons, 57. The other, Don Logan, 61, who heads Time Warner's publishing, cable and online properties, will retire at the end of the year and become nonexecutive chairman of the company's cable business. Mr. Bewkes is perhaps best known for his time at HBO, where he made his mark -- and HBO's reputation -- with hit programs like ''The Sopranos'' and ''Sex and the City.'' In an interview, Mr. Bewkes said he did not anticipate any immediate executive changes. That may be because he will be busy fending off a campaign by the financier Carl C. Icahn to make major changes at the company to raise its stock price. LUNCH TAB -- A California jury ordered Wal-Mart Stores to pay $172 million in damages for failing to provide meal breaks to nearly 116,000 hourly workers as required under state law. The suit, filed on behalf of employees of Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores in California, argued that the chain violated state law more than eight million times. California law requires that employers provide a meal break of 30 minutes for every five hours on the clock. If the break is shorter than that, provided late or not at all, the employer must pay an hour's pay. Wal-Mart, which faces similar cases in about 40 other states, said it planned to appeal. LATEST INDICTMENT -- Joseph P. Nacchio, the former chief executive of Qwest Communications, the dominant local phone company in 14 Western states, was indicted for selling more than $100 million worth of stock in his company in 2001 after learning that it would miss its financial goals but before making that news public. In a separate action in March, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Mr. Nacchio and other former executives, accusing them of overstating $3 billion in revenue from 1999 to 2002. It said the inflated figures helped Mr. Nacchio earn $216 million in pay and bonuses. In court, he pleaded not guilty. Several other former Qwest executives have already pleaded guilty and cooperated with government investigators. Qwest agreed last month to pay $400 million to investors hurt by the false financial statements. It also agreed to pay $250 million in fines to the S.E.C. last year. Prosecutors and the defense team are scheduled to meet on Jan. 20 in federal court in Denver, where Qwest is based, to set a timetable for the trial. PULLING THE PLUG -- Burdened with debts used to build power plants and with long-term contracts obligating it to sell electricity below the cost of making it, Calpine, a symbol of market deregulation, filed for bankruptcy protection. Calpine was hurt by the California energy crisis, which sent prices soaring after the company locked itself into long-term contracts, and by the collapse of Enron, which provided much of the liquidity in electricity-trading markets. Calpine, which employs 3,300 people, has $2 billion of debtor-in-possession financing, which is enough to keep its plants operating for now. But creditors are maneuvering to seize its assets, which include one of the world's largest geothermal plants, in Northern California. POWER GRAB -- In one of the largest takeovers in the electricity industry, the FPL Group agreed to buy Constellation Energy for $11 billion, creating a company that will own the nation's largest portfolio of electricity generation assets, with more than 45,000 megawatts of capacity. The combined company will have revenue of about $27 billion and will be the third-largest provider of nuclear-fueled electricity and one of the largest operators of coal-fired power plants. More mergers are likely after February, when the federal government repeals legislation that prevents conglomerates from using power monopolies to overcharge customers and subsidize other businesses. A DEAL, SORT OF -- Trade ministers from around the world agreed to stop subsidizing agricultural exports by 2013 and took steps to make it easier for the poorest nations to sell goods to industrialized nations. But the talks, held in Hong Kong under the guidance of the World Trade Organization, did little to persuade rich countries to lower import tariffs or limit subsidies to their own farmers and ranchers. The agreement helps negotiators as they try to finish a comprehensive set of trade rules by the end of 2007, in time for President Bush to submit it to Congress before a Congressional deadline expires. GAME OVER? -- Electronic Arts, the largest independent game publisher, and Activision, a big competitor, said holiday sales of their computer and video games were unexpectedly weak. NPD, a market research company, said domestic game sales fell 18 percent last month, to $700 million, from November a year ago. Paradoxically, a big reason for the slowdown may be the success of the Microsoft Xbox 360 console. Because Microsoft did not make enough to satisfy demand, consumers waiting to buy an Xbox 360 may have stopped buying games for other consoles, like the original Xbox and the Sony PlayStation 2. The slump may be reversed next year, when more Xbox 360's are in the hands of consumers and after Sony, the leading console maker, and Nintendo release new versions of their hardware.
