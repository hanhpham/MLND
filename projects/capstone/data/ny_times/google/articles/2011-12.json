For example, the case that was decided Monday involved the technology that lets you tap your finger once on the touch screen to call a phone number that is written inside an e-mail or text message. It also involves the technology that allows you to schedule a calendar appointment, again with a single tap of the finger, for a date mentioned in an e-mail. </p><p> It was an issue that Steven P. Jobs, Apple\u2019s late chief executive, felt passionate about. He told his biographer that Google had improperly copied many of the iPhone\u2019s innovations, and that he was going to \u201cdestroy Android, because it\u2019s a stolen product.\u201d </p><p> The ruling got wide coverage. Darrell Etherington of <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/apple/apple-wins-import-ban-on-select-htc-smartphones/\">GigaOm</a> noted that Samsung made changes to the Galaxy Tab 10.1N in Germany in order to comply with a patent ruling against it there. He said \u201cit\u2019s very possible HTC will find a workaround before the import ban is scheduled to take effect on April 19, 2012. But such a workaround could chip away at Android\u2019s usability and create a more frustrating experience for users.\u201d </p><p> Rik Myslewski at <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/12/20/itc_apple_patent_ruling/\">The Register</a> concluded: \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that HTC is about to be forced out of the U.S. market anytime in the foreseeable future, but it\u2019s equally unlikely that the end of the Apple-Android patent war is anywhere in sight.\u201d </p>", "print_page": null, "word_count": "313", "document_type": "blogpost", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/20/daily-report-apples-win-in-patent-ruling-hits-google/", "multimedia": [{"width": 600, "url": "images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-articleLarge.jpg", "height": 400, "subtype": "xlarge", "legacy": {"xlargewidth": "600", "xlarge": "images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargeheight": "400"}, "type": "image"}, {"width": 75, "url": "images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-thumbStandard.jpg", "height": 75, "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75"}, "type": "image"}], "keywords": [], "subsection_name": null, "_id": "54f33c0338f0d8529ba36559", "byline": {"person": [], "original": "By THE NEW YORK TIMES", "organization": "The New York Times"}, "section_name": "Technology"}, {"type_of_material": "Blog", "snippet": "The maker of the iPhone won a battle against HTC on Monday in a struggle for global cellphone supremacy, with ruling that affects the underlying Android operating system created by Google.
