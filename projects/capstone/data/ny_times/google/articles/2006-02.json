In Washington, Alan Greenspan presided over his last meeting as chairman of the Federal Reserve at the same time as the Senate was voting to confirm his successor. In Houston, the two most senior former executives of Enron went on trial for conspiracy and fraud. JUDGMENT DAY -- It took four and a half years to bring Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling to trial, but only a day to pick the jury that would decide whether the two former Enron chief executives lied to investors about the company's finances as it careered toward the largest corporate collapse in American history.", "headline": {"main": "Greenspan Heads Out and the Enron Two Head to Court", "kicker": "FIVE DAYS"}, "pub_date": "2006-02-04T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "Mark Stein Five Days column; Alan Greenspan ended his tenure as chairman of Federal Reserve; lawyers said former Enron executives Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling are expected to testify in their own defense at trial; high energy costs prompted some political leaders to call for windfall profits tax on oil companies; Google said it expects its tax rate this year to be 30 percent; Kraft Foods, in bid to increase margins, said it plans to reduce brand portfolio by about 10 percent and focus on increasing sales of Sensible Solutions products; Pres Bush called for bipartisan commission to examine ways to deal with problems in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid; photo (M)", "print_page": "2", "word_count": 964, "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/04/business/04five.ready.html", "multimedia": [], "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "SKILLING, JEFFREY K"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BUSH, GEORGE W"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GREENSPAN, ALAN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "LAY, KENNETH L"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ENRON CORPORATION"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "KRAFT FOODS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ENRON CORP"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FRAUDS AND SWINDLING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTANTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TAXATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES ECONOMY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "OIL (PETROLEUM) AND GASOLINE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICAID"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SOCIAL SECURITY (US)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ETHICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WINDFALL PROFITS TAX"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD"}], "subsection_name": null, "_id": "4fd251e38eb7c8105d7f6e10", "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Mark", "middlename": "A.", "lastname": "Stein", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By Mark A.

Alito Jr. as the 110th justice of the Supreme Court in a vote largely along party lines. He was sworn in two hours later. Behind the News -- The Democratic threat of a filibuster to block the nomination turned out to be largely empty. A small number of senators tried to stage a filibuster but lost a motion to close debate, 72 to 25. Many Democrats apparently took to heart Republican warnings that they would change the rules to bar filibusters against future judicial nominees if the effort against Judge Alito succeeded. QUICK PICKS The News -- The judge in the trial of two former Enron executives chose a jury in a single day. Behind the News -- Judge Simeon T. Lake III of Federal District Court in Houston followed through on his promise to act quickly, despite reservations voiced by lawyers for the defendants, Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, who are accused of conspiring to defraud investors. Judge Lake winnowed 96 prospective jurors down to 38 and then gave both sides 40 minutes to eliminate others. The trial itself won't be so quick: it may last up to four months. QUICK DROP The News -- Google's stock price dropped more than 7 percent in a day when its fourth-quarter earnings failed to meet analysts' expectations. Behind the News -- The Web search company's fiscal results would make most chief executives crow with pride. But earnings of $372 million in the last quarter of 2005 -- an 82 percent increase from the same period a year before -- weren't enough for some investors, and per-share earnings were far below analysts' forecasts. The company had also weathered some rare bad publicity -- a new video download store was panned by some critics, and Google said it would enter the Chinese market with a version of its search engine that filters words and subjects deemed inappropriate by government censors. By the close of regular trading Wednesday, the stock was 15 percent lower than its high-water mark, reached only three weeks before. QUICK WINDFALL The News -- Wallace D. Malone Jr. received retirement benefits of $135 million when he stepped down as vice chairman of Wachovia. Behind the News -- Mr. Malone, 69, had only been on the job for 15 months. Before that he was chief executive of SouthTrust, which Wachovia bought in 2004. Most of the $135 million was awarded during Mr. Malone's time at SouthTrust. Advocates for better corporate governance said the deal should have been scrutinized when the acquisition was made.

A1 At least four Iraqis were killed in scattered violence across Iraq, as thousands of Iraqi soldiers and police officers began to move into place to protect Shiite pilgrims for a religious holiday this week. A12 The American military has begun leaving the duty of policing the Iraqi heartland to Iraqi soldiers and special forces. The overwhelmingly Shiite forces are using tough tactics and restoring some order, but are also provoking enduring bitterness among the country's Sunnis, which risks fueling the insurgency.

A8 Protest Against Thai Leader Opponents of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of Thailand organized a huge demonstration in Bangkok, and a second cabinet minister resigned as criticism mounted over Mr. Thaksin's recent business deals. A6 Spain Faces Catalonian Break Spain's prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, will try to make good on a 2004 campaign promise by shepherding Catalonian demands for autonomous rule through Spain's national Parliament. A10 Questions After Ferry Crash Under Egyptian law, a person is listed as missing for three years before the state grants a death certificate to the family.

A1 Playing Poker to Raise Money Rushing to cash in on the Texas hold 'em craze, charities from local churches and community groups to giants like the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation are using poker events to raise money, in some cases ignoring state laws that outlaw such gambling. A1 G.O.P. Chairman on Offensive The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Ken Mehlman, offered a broad attack on Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, describing her as a Democrat brimming with anger and a representative of the far left wing of her party. A16 Regulation of Road Memorials Roadside memorials have become so numerous, and so distracting and dangerous, highway officials say, that more and more states are trying to regulate them. Now, in a move that is being watched by other states, Delaware is taking a different approach, establishing a memorial park near a highway exit in hopes of discouraging the personal shrines. A1 Fugitive Killed in Shootout A teenager accused of attacking patrons of a gay bar in Massachusetts with a hatchet and a handgun last week was fatally wounded in a shootout with the police in Arkansas.

A14 Lag in Bird Flu Plans The nation's 5,000 state and local health departments are rushing to make plans for an epidemic of avian flu, but they say they are hobbled by a lack of money and guidance from the federal government. A1 Parallels in Eavesdropping Case As the Senate prepares to hold hearings on domestic eavesdropping by the National Security Agency, some old Washington hands see a striking similarity.

Betty, who was in the same boat, was feeling restless and dissatisfied.
