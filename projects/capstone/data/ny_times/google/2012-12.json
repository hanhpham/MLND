Same-day shipping is logistically complicated and money-losing \u2014 and may not even be a service that consumers want or need, analysts say. But retailers big and small are willing to take the risk. Even the Postal Service has introduced a same-day option for retailers. And the reason is simple: fear of Amazon.com.\r\n\r\n<p>Amazon, the world\u2019s biggest online retailer, has hinted that it will expand its same-day shipping service, giving customers the immediate gratification that has been the biggest advantage of brick-and-mortar stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Big retailers like Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Macy\u2019s and Target have worked with eBay to deliver items the same day, as have other old-line stores. Google has begun testing a local delivery service with several chains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s lots going on in this space, and it\u2019s all driven by Amazon,\u201d said Tom Allason, founder and chief executive of Shutl, a British same-day delivery service that will expand to the United States next year. \u201cIt\u2019s not really being driven by consumers at the moment.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same-day delivery idea was a spectacular failure during the dot-com boom. Companies like Kozmo.com and Webvan went under because the services simply cost too much to be profitable. Amazon has offered same-day shipping since 2009, but with limits \u2014 only in big cities near Amazon warehouses on certain items ordered in the morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The geographical limits exist because Amazon had built warehouses far from major cities to avoid charging sales tax in certain states. But it has now given in on the sales tax fight, and in return, is erecting warehouses near cities like San Francisco, which analysts say is paving the way for faster, more widespread same-day delivery and spurring competitors.</p>", "print_page": null, "word_count": "304", "document_type": "blogpost", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/28/daily-report-online-retailers-push-same-day-shipping/", "multimedia": [{"width": 600, "url": "images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-articleLarge.jpg", "height": 400, "subtype": "xlarge", "legacy": {"xlargewidth": "600", "xlarge": "images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargeheight": "400"}, "type": "image"}, {"width": 75, "url": "images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-thumbStandard.jpg", "height": 75, "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75"}, "type": "image"}], "keywords": [], "subsection_name": null, "_id": "50dda82800315214fbb817ae", "byline": {"person": [], "original": "By THE NEW YORK TIMES", "organization": "The New York Times"}, "section_name": "Technology"}, {"type_of_material": "Question", "snippet": "Karen May, vice president for people development at Google, says that many executives have trouble telling workers how they can improve their performance....", "news_desk": "SundayBusiness", "lead_paragraph": "Karen May, vice president for people development at Google, says that many executives have trouble telling workers how they can improve their performance.", "headline": {"seo": "Karen May of Google, on Conquering Fears of Giving Feedback", "main": "Conquering Your Fears of Giving Feedback", "kicker": "Corner Office", "print_headline": "Conquering Your Fears of Giving Feedback", "content_kicker": "Corner Office"}, "pub_date": "2012-12-30T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "Adam Bryant Corner Office features interview with Google vice president Karen May discussing her management style.", "print_page": "2", "word_count": "1087", "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/business/karen-may-of-google-on-conquering-fears-of-giving-feedback.html", "multimedia": [{"width": 190, "url": "images/2012/12/30/business/30corner-pic/30corner-pic-thumbWide.jpg", "height": 126, "subtype": "wide", "legacy": {"wide": "images/2012/12/30/business/30corner-pic/30corner-pic-thumbWide.jpg", "wideheight": "126", "widewidth": "190"}, "type": "image"}, {"width": 75, "url": "images/2012/12/30/business/30corner-pic/30corner-pic-thumbStandard.jpg", "height": 75, "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2012/12/30/business/30corner-pic/30corner-pic-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75"}, "type": "image"}], "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "is_major": "Y", "value": "Google Inc", "name": "organizations"}, {"rank": "2", "is_major": "Y", "value": "May, Karen", "name": "persons"}, {"rank": "3", "is_major": "Y", "value": "Executives and Management (Theory)", "name": "subject"}, {"rank": "4", "is_major": "N", "value": "Workplace Environment", "name": "subject"}, {"rank": "5", "is_major": "N", "value": "Labor and Jobs", "name": "subject"}, {"rank": "6", "is_major": "N", "value": "Performance Evaluations (Labor)", "name": "subject"}], "subsection_name": null, "_id": "50df4b8e00315214fbb81a84", "byline": {"contributor": "", "person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Adam", "rank": 1, "lastname": "BRYANT"}], "original": "By ADAM BRYANT"}, "section_name": "Business Day"}, {"type_of_material": "", "snippet": "Google Maps called it Paradise Trailer Park.
