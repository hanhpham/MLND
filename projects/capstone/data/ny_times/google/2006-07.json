A1 U.S. Stresses Talks with Korea The top American negotiator with North Korea, Christopher R.

A9 NATIONAL A11-15 Republican Gives Details Of Intelligence Withheld Peter Hoekstra, left, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the Bush administration briefed the panel on a ''significant'' intelligence program only after a government whistle-blower alerted him to its existence and he pressed Mr. Bush for details. A11 Court's Decision Divides G.O.P. The Supreme Court decision striking down the use of military commissions to bring terrorism detainees to trial has set off sharp differences among Republicans in Congress over what kind of rights detainees should be granted and how much deference should be shown the president in deciding the issue. A1 Tough Race for Republican Rick Santorum, the third-ranking Republican leader in the Senate, is fighting for his political life, trying to convince his Pennsylvania constituents that he has not gone ''Washington.''

A1 Florida Mayor Pushes Fines The mayor of Avon Park, Fla., is pushing a proposal to root out and punish landlords who rent to illegal immigrants, fining them $1,000 for every such tenant. The plan has supporters across the country, but civil rights organizations and the town's immigrant community and farmers want to strike it down. A11 Football Lures Male Students Some small American colleges, eager to attract men to increasingly female campuses, have taken notice of how many students can be lured to attend by adding a football team. Officials say football can bring in more tuition-paying students than any other course or activity -- and not just players themselves. A1 NEW YORK/REGION B1-5 Small Towns Resist High-Voltage Towers Private power companies looking to supply the New York City area with electric power from upstate sources are facing opposition from residents in small hamlets where high-voltage transmission towers would be built. They have become the first battleground over a law that expanded federal powers to meet energy needs.

The summer travel season has started with airlines reporting record load factors, or the percentage of seats filled with paying customers. Here are the figures for June from the top six airlines: The load factor at United Airlines was 88.3 percent, the highest ever. The load factor at Delta Air Lines was 84.6 percent, largely driven by a 30.6 percent increase in international passengers over June 2005; on June 30, Delta's flights were 94.4 percent full -- the highest daily load factor ever, the airline said. The June load factor at US Airways was 84.3 percent, and at Northwest Airlines, it was 89.7 percent, also the highest ever. At Continental Airlines, the June figure was 84.8 percent. But at Southwest Airlines, by comparison, the load factor was a relatively roomy 73.8 percent. Meanwhile, flight delays are mounting. The 20 top domestic carriers achieved an overall on-time arrival rate of 78.3 percent in May, compared with 83.7 percent in May 2005, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics of the Transportation Department. At the same time, airlines have fewer employees to handle increased business. In April, domestic airlines employed 4.8 percent fewer workers than in April 2005; that means April 2006 was the 16th consecutive month that the work force was lower than in the year-ago month, the bureau said. LESS ROOM, MORE MONEY AT THE INN -- Hotel rooms are going to be harder to find and they are going to cost more this summer than last, according to PKF Hospitality Research, which says domestic hotel occupancy rates are likely to average nearly 74.1 percent, the highest level since 1997. Room rates are forecast to be up 6 percent over last summer. And forget about just dropping in unexpectedly. ''It will be tough to find a hotel room during the summer of 2006 without booking in advance,'' said R. Mark Woodworth, president of PKF Hospitality Research. TRANS-ATLANTIC BOOM -- With June load factors at 72 percent, the all-business-class carrier Eos Airlines said it was beginning a second daily flight in September from Kennedy International Airport to Stansted Airport in London. Eos, which began service last October, flies Boeing 757-200 aircraft, which typically hold 220 seats, configured with 48 premium lie-flat seats. Eos round-trip fares range from $2,950 for advance purchase to $6,500 walk-up (compared with more than $9,000 walk-up on major competitors). Reflecting the growing demand for New York-to-London service, British Airways said it was adding an eighth daily flight from Kennedy to Heathrow International Airport in December. British Air also has three daily flights serving Newark and Heathrow. BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE -- Many corporations are evidently returning to a policy that was sharply curtailed in the years after 9/11 -- allowing their traveling employees to tack a little time onto business trips for personal pleasure. According to the latest National Business Travel Monitor, 44 percent of business travelers now agree that they ''extend business trips for pleasure purposes'' whenever possible. That's up from 40 percent this time last year, according to YPB&R/Yankelovich, which publishes the monitor. NORTHWEST ELITE LANES -- Northwest has now joined several competitors and set aside special boarding lanes at departure gates for elite-status members of its WorldPerks frequent-flier program. The first-to-board lanes are also available to nonelite passengers with first class or World Business Class tickets, and to elite-status members of frequent flier programs of other airlines in the SkyTeam Alliance. COMPANION FLIERS -- Flying with a pet is, of course, infinitely more convenient on a private jet. Noting that many of its customers do take a pet along, NetJets, the leading fractional-share business jet company, has added a service giving domestic customers 24-hour telephone access for emergency or even general consultations with experts at the Matthew J. Ryan Veterinary Hospital at the University of Pennsylvania. NetJets said it flew nearly 10,000 pets on about 6,500 flights last year. Dogs and cats predominate, of course, but the pets have included a falcon, a wolf and a 250-pound kangaroo, said Maryann Aarseth, a NetJets spokeswoman. ONLINE HITS -- According to the online travel-data company Hitwise.com, these were the top 10 travel sites in May, ranked by the number of visits: MapQuest; Yahoo Maps; Expedia; Orbitz; Travelocity; Southwest Airlines; Cheap Tickets; Google Maps; Priceline; and Yahoo Travel. ET CETERA -- The most preferred hotel loyalty program in the world is Hilton HHonors, according to a survey of domestic and international travelers by Phoenix Marketing. But in the United States, Hilton HHonors shared the top-rated status with Marriott Rewards JetBlue just started more new routes: Burbank-Orlando, Fla.; Burbank-Las Vegas; and Boston-Buffalo, as well as routes from Pittsburgh to Kennedy International Airport and Pittsburgh to Boston. In September, JetBlue plans to start three new daily nonstops from Kennedy to Hobby Airport in Houston, with introductory one-way fares of $99.

But that reputation has been sullied in recent years, as clay and other particles washed into upstate reservoirs have made the water murkier. As a stopgap measure, the city has been using 16 tons of chemicals a day to purify the water so that it meets federal standards. But the Environmental Protection Agency says a full-scale filtration plant, which could cost about $8 billion, may be necessary.", "headline": {"main": "Setbacks | July 16-22", "kicker": "THE WEEK"}, "pub_date": "2006-07-23T00:00:00Z", "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 528, "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501E5DD143FF930A15754C0A9609C8B63", "multimedia": [], "keywords": [], "subsection_name": null, "_id": "4fd271ac8eb7c8105d82e052", "byline": null, "section_name": "Week in Review"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "snippet": "Do Internet users prefer predictable services like Yahoo, or are they more interested in Google\u2019s wow factor?...", "news_desk": "Business", "lead_paragraph": "Do Internet users prefer predictable services like Yahoo, or are they more interested in Google\u2019s wow factor?", "headline": {"main": "In the Race With Google, It\u2019s Consistency vs. \u2018Wow\u2019", "print_headline": "In the Race With Google, It\u2019s Consistency vs. the \u2018Wow\u2019 Factor"}, "pub_date": "2006-07-24T00:00:00Z", "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": "1801", "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/24/technology/24yahoo.html", "multimedia": [{"width": 190, "url": "images/2006/07/24/technology/24yahoo_190.gif", "height": 126, "subtype": "wide", "legacy": {"wide": "images/2006/07/24/technology/24yahoo_190.gif", "wideheight": "126", "widewidth": "190"}, "type": "image"}, {"width": 75, "url": "images/2006/07/24/business/24yahoo.751.jpg", "height": 75, "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2006/07/24/business/24yahoo.751.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75"}, "type": "image"}], "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "is_major": "N", "value": "Google Inc", "name": "organizations"}, {"rank": "2", "is_major": "N", "value": "Yahoo Inc", "name": "organizations"}, {"rank": "3", "is_major": "N", "value": "Computers and the Internet", "name": "subject"}, {"rank": "4", "is_major": "N", "value": "America Online Inc", "name": "organizations"}, {"rank": "5", "is_major": "N", "value": "MSN", "name": "organizations"}, {"rank": "6", "is_major": "N", "value": "Electronic Mail", "name": "subject"}], "subsection_name": null, "_id": "54b04a7e38f0d8367c8414ac", "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Saul", "rank": 1, "lastname": "HANSELL"}], "original": "By SAUL HANSELL"}, "section_name": "Technology"}, {"type_of_material": "Summary", "snippet": "INTERNATIONAL   A3-11    Israel Mulls Outside Force To Patrol Lebanon Border  As Israel pounded southern Lebanon and the Hezbollah militia rained dozens more rockets on Israel's north, diplomatic efforts increased with growing discussion of a mult...", "news_desk": "Metropolitan Desk", "lead_paragraph": "INTERNATIONAL A3-11 Israel Mulls Outside Force To Patrol Lebanon Border As Israel pounded southern Lebanon and the Hezbollah militia rained dozens more rockets on Israel's north, diplomatic efforts increased with growing discussion of a multinational armed force being set up in the area. The Israeli prime minister spoke of a force consisting of European Union members with combat experience and the authority to take control of Lebanon's border and crossing points. A1 Israeli warplanes hit civilians escaping by vehicle from their villages in southern Lebanon at least six times in a series of fierce bombardments, witnesses and officials said. Lebanese Red Cross ambulance drivers complained about narrowly avoiding Israeli fire as they cleared out the wounded, and a Lebanese photographer was killed when an Israeli missile struck near her car. A1 Saudis Urge Cease-Fire A delegation from Saudi Arabia asked President Bush to push for a cease-fire in the war between Israel and the terrorist group Hezbollah. The foreign minister said he delivered a letter from the Saudi king, Abdullah, with suggestions for ending the violence. It met a cool reception from American Officials. A8 Syrian Calls U.S. Course Faulty The Bush administration's approach of indirectly pressuring Syria to drop support for Hezbollah is doomed to failure, said Bthaina Shaaban a top Syrian minister. Washington, she says, is ignoring reality if it thinks groups like Hezbollah and Hamas can be purged by allowing Israel to bomb at will. A9 Recruitment Troubles in Iraq Recruiting a new police force to battle the insurgents in Iraq has become a central element in the United States' plan to reduce American forces. American commanders face securing a modicum of cooperation from a wary population, and to contend with a campaign by insurgents to assassinate and intimidate the members of Iraq's fledgling security services. A10 Saddam Hussein was hospitalized after a hunger strike, and was being fed with a tube and given tests to ensure that he could continue to attend his trial, Iraqi and American officials said. Widespread sectarian violence returned after two days of relative calm, with at least 57 people killed in bombings in Baghdad and Kirkuk. A11 Artist Shadowed by Nazi Ties After years of obscurity, the first publicly financed exhibit since World War II of the work of Arno Breker, the German sculptor whose art so vividly expressed Nazi ideology that he became known as ''Hitler's favorite sculptor,'' is being mounted in Schwerin, Germany. The exhibit has ignited a debate in a region which has had a spurt of far-right and neo-Nazi political activity recently. A3 NATIONAL A12-15 U.S. to Limit Payments For Victims of Disaster The Department of Homeland Security, responding to months of criticism and ridicule, will sharply cut back on emergency cash assistance for victims of major disasters, and more carefully control access to free hotel rooms. Immediate emergency aid would not exceed $500 in cash instead of $2,000 per family under the new rules. A1 Bar Association Critical of Bush The American Bar Association said President Bush was flouting the Constitution and undermining the rule of law by claiming the power to disregard selected provisions of bills that he signed. In a comprehensive report, a bipartisan panel of the bar association said Mr. Bush had used such ''signing statements'' far more than his predecessor. A12 Sunday Services in Parks From Memorial Day to Labor Day, 42 state, national and private parks in Pennsylvania hold nondenominational Christian worship services. The chaplains come from local towns and faraway states, as do the worshipers, mostly Protestants. Last year, 18,000 people attended services in Pennsylvania parks. A13 Elderly Katrina Victims Struggle Thousands of elderly Hurricane Katrina evacuees still struggle to get by in cities hundreds of miles from their home in New Orleans. But more than most evacuees, it is the elderly who want most to return, say social service workers, and who have the hardest time doing so. A12 F.D.A. to Limit Industry Ties The Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce an effort to write guidelines detailing the kind of industry ties that are permitted for those who serve on its powerful advisory boards. The agency hopes to appease critics who have complained that board members often have such deep financial ties to drug makers that their advice is tainted. A13 SCIENCE/HEALTH Stomach Surgery Called Risky Four of every 10 patients who undergo weight-loss surgery develop complications within six months, the federal government said. The number of such surgical procedures has been rising rapidly, along with the incidence of obesity, which now afflicts 30 percent of adults in the United States, health officials said. A15 OBITUARIES B7 Thomas J. Manton A former congressman and New York City councilman who was chairman of the powerful Queens Democratic party for the past two decades, he was 73. B7 Walter Allner The Bauhaus-trained graphic designer and art director of Fortune magazine from 1962 to 1974 who introduced a European modernist typographic sensibility to American magazine design, he was 97. B7 NEW YORK/REGION B1-5 Progress Made Restoring Electricity to Queens Consolidated Edison reported major progress in the week-old struggle to restore power to northwest Queens, but thousands faced a new work week without electricity and frustrations boiled over as some officials called for a declaration of emergency and the resignation of the utility's chief executive. A1 Last Fishing Shop Moves Capitol Fishing and Tackle, the last bait and tackle shop in Manhattan, is leaving the Chelsea Hotel, where it has resided for more than four decades. B1 Campaign Draws Big Names With their race quickly becoming a national symbol of rifts in the Democratic party, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman and his challenger, Ned Lamont, are turning to national political stars to help bolster each of their campaigns, apparently hoping that the big names can help turn out votes in the coming primary for the Senate. B1 SPORTSMONDAY D1-8 Tiger Woods Wins British Open Tiger Woods shot five-under-par 67 at the 135th British Open to win the 11th professional major championship of his career.

C1 Internet Search Business The different approaches used by Google and Yahoo have defined a key front in the battle for online loyalty in the Internet search business.

C1 Panasonic's New Plasma TV Panasonic said that it would begin selling a 103-inch flat-panel plasma television in the United States in time for the holiday season.

[C1.] FIRST BOOKS, NOW GROCERIES -- Amazon introduced a grocery store last week, complete with sales rankings, customer reviews and recommendations. It is the 33rd product category Amazon has rolled out since it started expanding in the late 1990's, but for some it is the most puzzling, since it recalls some of the worst Internet business debacles on record. Maria Renz, above, who oversees the grocery unit, says typical customers tend to be busy parents who are ''looking for a good price and the most convenient way to buy what they need.''
