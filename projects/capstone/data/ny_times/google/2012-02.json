He died as he lived, with courage and humility, drawing upon an inner strength that never failed to inspire and amaze. Len was born and raised in New York City where his education included The BronxHigh School of Science, Queens College, Columbia University, and most importantly, the incredible libraries, museums, theatre, opera, and melting pot of New York City. The child of immigrants, Jenny and Zol, and brother to Emile, he inhaled the ideas and promises that America offered. Len later pursued his doctorate at the University of California, Davis, where he met Marilyn, who would become his wife and partner for the next 43 years. Len earned a BA, two master's degrees, and PhD, abd. He was a student of the world, studying art, languages, history, and most recently, ukulele. There was never a need for an encyclopedia for Len was the Encyclopedia Britannica; Google before there was Google. Len launched his career at the United Nations, and spent over ten years with the Peace Corps directing programs in India, Iran, Micronesia, and the Solomon Islands. Later he served as Executive Director of the International Institute of the East Bay, after a decade as Director of Human Resources for Icore, International in Silicon Valley. Len was a quiet force who offered books, ideas, and encouragement to any who crossed his path. He will be loved and remembered by his wife, his children and their families, his grandchildren, his brother-in-law, his nephew and nieces and their families, and by all he touched and nurtured.
