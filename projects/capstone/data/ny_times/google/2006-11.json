[C1.] WEB ACCESS FOR THE BLIND -- Although commercial Web sites have made considerable strides in serving the blind, there are still major difficulties on both sides of the screen. ''Web sites are more useful than they used to be, but there are still a few more hurdles than you'd like to have to go through,'' said James Gashel, above, an executive director for the National Federation of the Blind, which is based in Baltimore. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. [C6.] GOOGLE AND PRINT ADS -- Google is planning to start selling advertisements that will appear in the print editions of 50 major newspapers.

[C1.] PUTTING THE SQUEEZE ON TALENT -- Movie and television studios, which are facing escalating budgets, rampant piracy and the uncertain future of new media, are demanding concessions from their talent. And actors, directors and writers are not happy about it. [C1.] EYES ON VIVENDI -- Is Vivendi in play? That was the question being whispered among the world's media moguls over the weekend after it emerged that Vivendi had held talks with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company over a potential $50 billion takeover bid, which would have been the largest leveraged buyout offer in history. [C1.] ONLINE HIRE AT CBS -- In an effort to expand into the online world, CBS Inc. said it had hired Quincy Smith, formerly of Allen and Company, to oversee its interactive strategy. [C6.] NEW VIEWS ON ADVERTISING -- A widely followed annual survey of the relationships between advertisers and agencies shows some improvement from last year's results, many of which reached record 20-year lows. Even so, the survey suggests that Madison Avenue is still struggling to adjust to profound new challenges, which range from adjusting to the rapid rise of new media to the difficulty of recruiting talented employees. [C8.] ADVERTISING SHIFT IN FRANCE -- A round of musical chairs that is reshaping the upper ranks of the French advertising world continued last week when Maurice L\u00e9vy, chief executive of Publicis Groupe, named three executives to key positions in Paris. [C7.] THE MEDICATED PENGUIN -- An animated movie about a tap-dancing penguin is venturing beyond the Antarctic, with a promotional tie-in to pharmaceuticals. Characters from the family film ''Happy Feet'' appear in an extensive advertising campaign -- including national network and cable commercials, full-page magazine ads and online banner ads -- for the drug maker Roche.

A1 The death penalty for Mr. Hussein and two of his co-defendants brought jubilation to Shiite and Kurdish neighborhoods across Iraq, gloom to Sunni ones, and a political blessing for its current, embattled prime minister. A11 Taiwan's Leader Admits Lies President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan admitted he submitted false receipts for reimbursement from public funds and lied to prosecutors about how he spent the money, but said he had done so in the interest of national security. A6 China Sets African Trade Deals China and a number of African nations agreed on 16 trade and investment deals valued at $1.9 billion, as Beijing extended its efforts to create a broad economic and diplomatic partnership with Africa. A6 Nicaraguans Vote for Leader Nicaraguans went to the polls to choose a new president in a five-way contest that primarily focused on one contender: Daniel Ortega, the former Marxist president who fought American-backed contras in a bloody war in the 1980s. A8 Israel Firm on Gaza Offensive Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel said the military would not halt its offensive in the northern Gaza Strip until Palestinian rocket fire toward Israel was reduced. A11 Snag for Kosovo Independence The hopes of ethnic Albanians that Kosovo would be granted independence by the end of this year were placed in doubt as Secretary General Kofi Annan said a decision on the future of the United Nations-administered province could be delayed. A8 Turk Hints at Freer Speech Prime Minister Recep Erdogan of Turkey signaled he was prepared to amend a law limiting free speech, a surprise move that was apparently an 11th-hour attempt to prevent a crisis with the European Union over Turkey's troubled membership talks. A8 NATIONAL A12-19 G.O.P. Finds Issues For Rallying Its Voters President Bush seized on the sentencing of Saddam Hussein as a ''milestone'' in Iraq, seeking to rally Republican voters with the issue of national security as some polls suggested that his party might be making gains in the final hours of the campaign. The White House said the timing of the announcement, two days before Election Day, had nothing to do with American politics. A1 Campaigning Coast to Coast To inspire his troops on the last big day of campaigning for the midterm elections, Representative Mike Fitzpatrick, a Republican in his first term, pulled out a favorite weapon of Republican candidates in the same predicament: Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican whose reputation as a maverick makes him an appealing attraction. A17 In one of the tightest races in the country, Indiana's Ninth Congressional District, an important economic concern, high gasoline prices, has been somewhat alleviated in the past few weeks as the price at the pump has edged down. A17 A new poll, which queried 400 likely voters and was published by The Miami Herald, found that 49 percent said they preferred the Democratic challenger, State Senator Ron Klein, to Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr. , who drew the support of 40 percent of respondents. A17 As volunteers lined up to carry the last paper sacks of leaflets into a web of suburbs to the west of Chicago, Iraq loomed over the tense race for the Congressional seat that is being vacated by Henry J. Hyde, a Republican. A17 Many Candidates Unopposed Though the Democrats need only 15 seats to take control of the House, 34 House candidates (30 Democrats and 4 Republicans) have no opponent at all. A16 Minister Asks for Forgiveness Thousands of people gathered at the Colorado Springs church whose founder, Ted Haggard, was dismissed for ''sexually immoral conduct.'' Speakers urged the church's members to find a way forward without recrimination or bitterness; a letter from Mr. Haggard was read from the 8,000-seat auditorium's center stage, urging forgivness for the Denver man who broke the story. A12 NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 Final Political Push Is Felt By Voters in New Jersey Volunteers bounded from door to door, the airwaves filled with advertisements and carefully chosen political celebrities popped up across New Jersey as the state became a battlefield for both parties in the final days of the midterm campaign. With Democrats appearing within reach of gaining the six seats they need to take control of the United States Senate, New Jersey has become a focus of national attention. B1 State Republicans Cry Foul Anticipating historic political losses in New York on Election Day, state Republican leaders are lashing out at the national party in Washington, saying it has exploited New York donors and missed opportunities against a prime target, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. They say that, despite pleas for help, they have been ignored in Washington. B1 Cigarette Trade in Jeopardy The tax-free sale of steeply discounted cigarettes by the Shinnecock Indian Outpost in Southampton is what keeps the tribe alive. But now the cigarette trade is being threatened by both a federal lawsuit and an expected push by the New York State government, which estimates it loses $576 million a year in the sale of untaxed cigarettes. B1 Brooklyn Development Faulted Even in Greenpoint-Williamsburg, an area familiar with growth and gentrification, the sweeping changes wrought by the city's rezoning have left many residents feeling dizzied, and there is a sense that the government has not moved fast enough to keep pace with developers. B1 Neediest Cases B6 ARTS E1-10 Students Build in Mississippi Architects in training at Parsons the New School for Design volunteered for six weeks of rugged work in hurricane-ravaged Mississippi, conceiving and building a combination information center and laundromat. E1 World War II Photos Unearthed Close to 800 images by the photographer Dorothea Lange depicting the World War II-era internment of Japanese and Japanese-American citizens have been unearthed in the National Archives, where they had lain neglected for a half-century after being impounded by the government. E1 BUSINESS DAY C1-10 Medicare and Democrats Democrats, who have long charged that the drug industry is profiteering at taxpayers' expense, say they want to introduce legislation to revoke the law that bars Medicare from negotiating prices directly with drug makers like Pfizer for the medicines it buys. C1 Studios Seek Concessions Movie and television studios, facing escalating budgets, rampant piracy and the uncertain future of new media, are demanding concessions from actors, directors and writers.

Among the speakers will be Jeffrey P. Bezos, below, of Amazon.com, who is expected to talk about selling more Web services to business customers, as opposed to his traditional business of selling products to individual consumers. Other prominent names on the agenda are Chad Hurley of YouTube, which is being sold to Google (the deal won antitrust approval last week) and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, who so far has resisted large buyout offers from big media companies. TRADE STATISTICS, ANYONE? -- The Commerce Department is scheduled to release trade deficit figures for September on Thursday. Economists expect that the number will drop a bit, thanks in part to a decline in crude oil prices. In August, the deficit reached a record $69.9 billion, swollen by high oil imports. The forthcoming figure is expected to be $65 billion, economists say. Also on Thursday, the Commerce Department will issue its report on import and export prices for October, which could offer insight on inflation trends. AIRING THE OPTIONS -- The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company,the French and German company that owns Airbus, will hold a board meeting to discuss possible plans to develop the A350 XWB, or extra-wide body, aircraft (Tuesday). Airbus has been muddling through one crisis after another, in part because of production problems with a bigger model, the A380 superjumbo jet. Now the company is examining all its options after a management change. MEDIA AND MESSAGES -- This will be another big week for quarterly earnings reports, with a heavy emphasis on media companies. Expect results from Liberty Media and RealNetworks (Monday); EchoStar Communications and Primedia (Tuesday); Cablevision, the DirecTV Group, the News Corporation and Sirius Satellite Radio (Wednesday); and Viacom and Walt Disney (Thursday). BOTTOM LINES -- Companies in other industries that will report earnings this week include Anadarko Petroleum, Sara Lee, Tenet Healthcare and Wynn Resorts (Tuesday); Avis Budget Group, Barr Pharmaceuticals, Cisco Systems, Dynegy, Federated, the Interpublic Group, Polo Ralph Lauren, Priceline.com and Sotheby's (Wednesday); and Expedia, J.

Those representatives, in turn, are encouraged to recruit others and are promised that they will receive a portion of new enlistees' profits. The companies profit, at least in part, by collecting increased revenue and fees paid by new sales representatives. In April, citing hundreds of fraud investigations, the Federal Trade Commission proposed new rules for multilevel marketing companies and related businesses. [Page C1.] SHORTCUT TO FASHION -- For fashionistas in lower tax brackets, reproducing the latest hip look from Lindsay Lohan or Paris Hilton can mean endless clicking through online retail sites and hit-or-miss searches on Google or shopping engines like Shopping.com. Now a new search site, Like.com, offers a shortcut for the budget-minded. The site and its chief executive, Munjal Shah, left, rely on artificial-intelligence technology to search images on the Web, and serve up goods for sale that visually match items on a shopper's wish list. E-Commerce Report, Bob Tedeschi. [C4.] LIFE IN THE STUDIO -- In an era when producers, directors and popular actors are required to toe a stricter line, even Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer, is feeling the squeeze. His contribution to Disney cannot be underestimated. He has produced 17 films for the studio since 1991. They have brought in $5 billion. As part of a shift under Robert A. Iger, the new Disney chief executive, the studio pledged to make fewer films and focus on family-friendly movies that are marketable across all the company's businesses. That means Mr. Bruckheimer is now in the onscreen amusement park business. [C1.] MOVING ON AFTER XBOX -- The hoopla was still swelling around November's debut of the Xbox 360, when some on its development team began conceiving a new product. Tomorrow, after committing hundreds of millions of dollars, Microsoft is scheduled to release the result of that research: the Zune. At a glance, it looks like yet another aspiring iPod rival. But the Zune can do something that no other player can claim: it can locate other Zune players and wirelessly exchange content with a few touches of a big shiny button. [C1.] MUSIC FILLS THE AIR -- The upscale department store Nordstrom, which has taken a chance on up-and-coming designers, is now betting on a different set of rising stars: musicians. Beginning this holiday season, the retailer will develop and sell a collection of CDs that, over time, is expected to rival the one carried by Starbucks, its corporate neighbor in Seattle. [C11.] TAKING A NEW PATH -- Two big advertisers known for following traditional ways of marketing products are expanding their efforts to become a little less conventional. Both, coincidentally, share the same creative and media agencies, which are also trying to demonstrate their eagerness to explore the brave world of new media. The advertisers are the General Electric Company and the Pepsi-Cola North America unit of PepsiCo. The agencies are both part of the Omnicom Group: BBDO Worldwide in New York for the creative parts of the campaigns and OMD for the media elements. Everyone on Madison Avenue ''is looking to push the envelope, find what is going to be the next big thing,'' said Jennifer Gordineer, group director for national investment on the PepsiCo account at OMD. Advertising, Stuart Elliott. [C8.] GETTING A SECOND CHANCE -- Even adults, it seems, are getting a little sick of their childhoods, long after everyone else has. So TV Land, the network best-known for reruns of ''The Andy Griffith Show,'' is unveiling programming to appeal to what the network sees as one of the next obsessions for baby boomers: optimism about having second careers and changing lifestyles. Having recently produced reality shows with Farrah Fawcett and Mr. T, the network, which is owned by Viacom, is now turning its cameras on George Foreman, the former heavyweight boxing champion-turned-grill purveyor. [C10.] FINANCING FOR ETHANOL -- The Mascoma Corporation, a company that is trying to produce ethanol from nontraditional sources, has received $30 million from a group of prominent venture capital investors. The investment, which is led by General Catalyst Partners, and includes Khosla Ventures, Flagship Ventures, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and others, is the latest in a string of venture capital financings of alternative energy companies. Khosla and Flagship invested $9 million in Mascoma earlier this year.

Behind the News -- Founded eight years ago in a Silicon Valley garage by two Stanford University graduate students, Google went public two years ago at $85 a share. The company now ranks as one of America's 15 largest companies, joining the likes of Exxon Mobil and Wal-Mart. Its founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, both 33, are each worth roughly $17 billion. And Google keeps expanding. It recently bought YouTube, the video-sharing site, for $1.65 billion in stock, and is investing billions in research, computers and a global communications network. Some analysts expect the stock price to reach $600 next year. Yahoo. A RECORD BUYOUT The News -- In the biggest leveraged buyout in history, the Blackstone Group, a private investment firm, agreed to acquire Equity Office Properties Trust, the nation's largest office-building owner and manager, for about $36 billion. Behind the News -- The deal eclipses the $33 billion paid earlier this year for H.C.A., the hospital chain, and will make Blackstone one of the nation's largest owners of real estate. The trust, with interests in 580 buildings and 108.6 million square feet of office space, will go from being a publicly held company to a private one. Samuel Zell, the real estate tycoon who founded Equity Office, told The Associated Press that Blackstone's offer was unsolicited. ''We got what we considered to be a significant offer at a price that we considered to be very attractive, and responded accordingly,'' he said. His stake could bring him $800 million. BONANZA ON WALL STREET The News -- The average weekly pay for financial sector jobs in Manhattan was $8,323 in the first quarter of 2006, up more than $3,000 per week in just three years, according to data collected by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Behind the News -- New York's dependence on Wall Street continues to grow. The 280,000 workers in the financial sector collect more than half of all the wages paid in Manhattan, but hold less than one in six of the 1.8 million jobs in the borough, according to the data. The good news on Wall Street may not be so good for others who live in New York. Michael L. Dolfman, the bureau's regional commissioner, said one consequence of the unequal distribution of income gains is that ''the middle class is being squeezed out of the city because of the tremendous purchasing power of the people in the global sectors of the economy.'' AN EYE ON THE WEALTHY The News -- The Internal Revenue Service reported a sharp increase in the number of tax audits for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 and warned high earners that they will continue to face scrutiny in the coming year. Behind the News -- One of every 16 taxpayers who earned $1 million or more faced audits last year, a 33 percent increase over the previous year. The agency also audited 257,000 taxpayers with incomes over $100,000, an increase of 18 percent and the most in more than a decade. Over all, nearly 1.3 million individual returns were audited. . The I.R.S. commissioner, Mark W. Everson, said the agency would continue to investigate high-income taxpayers to maintain ''faith'' in the system. ''If you earn more than $100,000 or you're a millionaire,'' he said, ''you're a lot more likely to be audited these days than just a few years ago.'' A VICTORY FOR JANITORS The News -- Ending a monthlong strike, the union representing 5,300 janitors in Houston and the city's major cleaning firms reached a tentative contract that raises their wages by nearly 50 percent over two years and provides them health coverage. Behind the News -- The organizing of the janitors last year by the Service Employees International Union was hailed by the labor movement as a major victory. The contract would gradually raise wages, which now average $5.25 an hour, to $7.75 by Jan. 1, 2009. The employers agreed to increase a janitor's typical shift to six hours a day, from four, and to provide health coverage. For a 30-hour week, a janitor would earn $232.50 in the final year, about $12,000 a year. ''It's a moment of great victory,'' said Mercedes Herrera, a janitor for five years who earns $5.15 an hour. ''I've earned the same ever since I started, so the raise is great.''", "headline": {"main": "Rich Man, Poor Man | Nov. 19-25", "kicker": "THE WEEK"}, "pub_date": "2006-11-26T00:00:00Z", "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 769, "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E2D6133EF935A15752C1A9609C8B63", "multimedia": [], "keywords": [], "subsection_name": null, "_id": "4fd257c98eb7c8105d802af4", "byline": null, "section_name": "Week in Review"}, {"type_of_material": "Blog", "snippet": "Google reached a settlement with Belgian photographers and journalists on Friday in a copyright dispute over how Google's news service links to newspaper content.
