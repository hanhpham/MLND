About 70 of India's most successful writers, including Amitav Ghosh, left, and Kiran Desai, are scheduled to present their work at the five-day event, which is expected to draw nearly 300,000 visitors to see some 7,000 exhibitors from 111 countries, Agence France-Presse reported. This year's event will also focus on the boom in electronic publishing, and Google Inc. is expected to be in the spotlight, since its efforts to make extracts of every book printed available online have prompted concerns with authors and publishers over copyright. Up All Night in Toronto Adventurous people of Toronto -- more than 400,000 of them -- stayed up and out on Saturday night and into Sunday morning at their first Nuit Blanche festival, which transformed the city into an art gallery, The Globe and Mail of Toronto reported. For 12 hours, beginning at 7:01 p.m. on Saturday, visitors attended more than 130 exhibits in galleries, churches and parks in what Mayor David Miller called ''an extraordinary night for the city.'' Toronto adopted the idea from Paris, where the first Nuit Blanche was held in October 2002. The event has since spread to Rome; Madrid; Naples, Italy; and Riga, Latvia. This year's Parisian version starts at sundown on Oct. 7. Woes for George Michael The British singer George Michael was arrested over the weekend when London police found him slumped over the wheel of his car and in possession of cannabis, Reuters reported. ''At about 3.22 a.m. on Sunday morning officers were informed of a stationary vehicle with a driver inside causing an obstruction,'' a police spokesman said. Mr. Michael, 43, was arrested in February this year in a scenario that was almost exactly the same as last weekend's. The singer's partner, Kenny Goss, told reporters Sunday night that Mr. Michael had no comment about the arrest. ''He's fine and I've got him a McDonald's,'' Mr. Goss said. Pl\u00e1cido Domingo in Print: Learn From a Master In ''The Joy of Opera,'' scheduled for publication in 2009, the renowned tenor Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, below, will offer insights into masterpieces and how opera works -- and can be enjoyed -- on both sides of the curtain, Reuters reported. ''Opera for so many people remains a mystery, a curious and strange art form, when it really should be much more part of our everyday lives,'' Mr. Domingo writes in the book, according to the publisher W. W. Norton, which has acquired the worldwide rights. Mr. Domingo, 65, is the general director of both the Los Angeles Opera and the Washington National Opera and continues to perform and conduct. Footnotes Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman are both slated to direct productions for the Sydney Theater Company in Australia in 2007. Ms. Blanchett's production of ''Blackbird,'' by David Harrower, will be her directorial debut. The actor Stephen Rea (''The Crying Game'') and the director Garry Hynes (''The Beauty Queen of Leenane'') will be among the participants in an Irish Theater Symposium at Princeton University Oct. 13 to 15, featuring discussions, readings and performances reflecting on Ireland's long theatrical history. The Very End The results of a survey released yesterday indicate that James Blunt's ''Goodbye My Lover'' is the song most requested at British funerals and remembrance services, with Robbie Williams's ''Angels'' coming in second. The survey, sponsored by The Bereavement Register, which removes from databases the names and addresses of people who have died, found that 51 percent of respondents ask for a specific song to be played at their funeral, and that 79 percent have talked with family and friends about possible choices. Some choices were ambiguous, though. Is it the deceased or someone left behind whom we are to imagine singing the words of the No. 9 song, Police's ''Every Breath You Take''? It includes the lyrics ''Every move you make/Every step you take/I'll be watching you.''", "headline": {"main": "Arts, Briefly"}, "pub_date": "2006-10-03T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "Annual Frankfurt book fair will focus on flourishing literary scene in India; 70 of India's most successful writers, including Amitav Ghosh and Kiran Desai, are scheduled to present their work; photo (S)", "print_page": "2", "word_count": 756, "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E0D91430F930A35753C1A9609C8B63", "multimedia": [], "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "DESAI, KIRAN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GHOSH, AMITAV"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "INDIA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FRANKFURT BOOK FAIR"}], "subsection_name": null, "_id": "4fd278ec8eb7c8105d83b45a", "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Steven", "lastname": "McElroy"}], "original": "Compiled by Steven McElroy"}, "section_name": "Arts; Books"}, {"type_of_material": "Blog", "snippet": "(An occasional look at the N.F.L's worst teams and how they got that way.

[Page A1.] SEQUOIA'S BIG PAYDAY -- The spoils of blockbuster Silicon Valley deals like the acquisition of YouTube by Google tend to be shared by a sizable group that includes company founders, employees, venture capitalists and other investors.

About 19.9 million shares changed hands, about nine times the daily average.

Steve Capus, president of NBC News, said the bulk of the cuts would come from eliminating jobs already vacant, as well as from early retirements and voluntary buyouts, but that some layoffs were inevitable. [C4.] LOWER COST PROGRAMMING -- As part of the extensive cost-cutting program it announced yesterday, NBC intends to dramatically alter its prime-time programming, starting in the fall of 2007, filling the 8 p.m. hour each night of the week with lower-cost, unscripted programs and saving its more expensive scripted comedies and dramas for the 9-to-11 block. [C1.] WEAK NEWSPAPER PROFITS -- Newspaper companies continued to show weakness, with The New York Times Company and the Tribune Company both reporting lackluster earnings, citing soft advertising sales as a major culprit. At the Times Company, the slowdown ''is expected to continue through the end of the year,'' said Janet L. Robinson, the company's president and chief executive. [C7.] ONLINE Business Briefing Articles on these developments are at nytimes.com/business. McDonald's reported a 15 percent rise in third-quarter profitmeeting a better-than-expected forecast it gave last week. (REUTERS) The UnitedHealth Group, the nation's largest provider of health insurance, said third-quarter net income rose 38 percent after acquisitions raised the number of policyholders. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) Travelers packed planes operated by Continental Airlines and Southwest Airlines over the summer, but Continental's third-quarter profit grew while Southwest's earnings fell in another sign that traditional carriers were narrowing the gap with low-cost rivals.

A1 Sudan's government ordered the chief United Nations envoy out of the country, saying he was an enemy of the country and its armed forces. Secretary General Kofi Annan said he was reviewing the letter from the Khartoum government and had asked the envoy, Jan Pronk, to return to New York for ''consultations.'' A11 18 Killed in Iraqi Violence A deadly ambush of police recruits north of Baghdad and multiple bombings against shoppers in the capital put a violent stamp on the preparations for the Muslim celebration marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan. The violence left at least 18 Iraqis dead overall, officials said. A10 A senior State Department official apologized for saying the United States has acted with ''arrogance'' and ''stupidity'' in its campaign in Iraq. A10 Panama Endorses Canal Plan Panamanians endorsed a plan to modernize the country's aging canal, won over by government arguments that the $5.25 billion project would generate jobs and keep the canal relevant for future generations. The overhaul, to begin next year, will double the canal's capacity. A3 Mideast Cease-Fire Crumbles Tensions between rival Fatah and Hamas loyalists continued to smolder in the form of a deadly shooting, a kidnapping and tire-burning protests as an informal cease-fire disintegrated after only a few days. In Jerusalem, some Israeli cabinet members called for retaking control of Gaza's border with Egypt. A6 India Rethinks Attack Evidence Three weeks after the police in India accused Pakistan's intelligence agency of colluding in serial bombings on the commuter train line in Mumbai, M. K. Narayanan, the Indian national security adviser, said in an interview broadcast on television that the evidence was short of ''clinching.'' A8 Clans Clash in Afghanistan Factional fighting between the followers of rival commanders of two Pashtun clans in the Afghan province of Herat killed 32 fighters and wounded numerous others, said an assistant to Ismail Khan, the former governor of Herat. A8 Serbian Unity on Constitution Serbia's leaders, normally riven by deep political rivalries, have shown a surprising degree of unity this month, as ultranationalists and reformers have joined together to support a recently drafted constitution that will be voted on in a referendum on Oct. 27 and 28. A11 NATIONAL A12-17 G.O.P. Leaders Aiming To Change View of Election The capital is filled with Republicans convinced they will lose the House and maybe the Senate. So last week, the White House and party leaders convened a ''friends and allies'' teleconference to dispute what Ken Mehlman, chairman of the Republican National Committee, considers flawed conventional wisdom. A1 A Costly Kansas Town A breakdown of new Census Bureau data shows that housing costs have risen as a burden in almost every part of the country since 2000. And it is hardly surprising that the coasts, in places like Southern California and Manhattan, figured prominently. But Olathe, Kan., is also at the top of the charts. A1 Energy Deregulation Aftermath The enormous profits from the purchase of energy companies were one surprising result of a huge deregulation effort on the part of 21 states a decade ago that overhauled the business of providing electricity, all in the name of stimulating competition and lowering utility bills. But even as some investors have profited, electricity customers have not fared so well. A1 Senator Considers White House Senator Barack Obama, the first-term Illinois Democrat who has rapidly emerged as one of the most popular figures in his party, said he was considering running for the White House in 2008, a shift in position that he said had come in response to many Democrats pressing him to join the field. A12 Fantasy Congress Makes Debut Fantasy Congress, a Web site created by four students at Claremont McKenna College, made its debut three weeks ago and through word of mouth and blog mentions has attracted almost 600 interested players from the Beltway to Texas. A12 Bush Promoter Reaches Deal The conservative commentator Armstrong Williams has reached a settlement with prosecutors regarding payments he received from the Education Department to promote President Bush's agenda. Under the settlement, Mr. Williams admits no wrongdoing but will have to pay $34,000 that prosecutors determined he had been overpaid. A16 Seniority as Campaign Asset Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Republican, plays up his 26 years in the House on the campaign trail, advising that he has ''a darned good shot'' at leading the powerful Ways and Means Committee. A14 Town Debates College Drinking Searchers combing the Mississippi River recently found the body of the eighth college-age man in nine years to disappear from a tavern in La Crosse, Wis., and turn up dead in a river. City officials have debated for years how to keep drunken students safe, but some say there may be no answer for a town with three colleges, three rivers and $3 pitchers of beer. A12 NEW YORK/REGION B1-7 Clinton Adheres to Script In Second and Final Debate Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton mixed gravitas and familiar talking points in the second and final debate with her Republican opponent, John Spencer. She challenged Bush administration policy on Iraq, Iran and North Korea while carefully defending her own record on abortion rights. B7 Quicker Citizenship, for Some Officials of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services say they have shrunk the average wait for a citizenship decision to five months. But to accomplish their mission, the agency has identified and stopped counting thousands of backlogged cases that they now define as outside the agency's control. B1 Blessing for Gay Unions Bishop Andrew D. Smith, the leader of the Episcopal diocese in Connecticut, has authorized priests to give blessings to same-sex unions during religious ceremonies. The move threatens to further alienate the conservative wing of his church and deepen a fissure between progressive and orthodox Episcopalians nationwide.

Lake will give Mr. Skilling a sentence of at least 25 years for his role in heading a conspiracy to defraud Enron investors. If it exceeds that, it would be the longest sentence ever handed down for a white-collar crime.

[C1.] GAP STARTS SHOE SITE -- The success of Zappos, the online shoe store, has enticed Gap Inc., which is in a sales slump, to introduce its own shoe site. Last week the company unveiled a new brand, Piperlime, on a Web site that features thousands of footwear styles from 150 brands. Toby C. Lenk, above, president of Gap Direct, the company's Internet division, said that his unit's recent technology upgrade had been paying off. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report.

[C1.] A TV SHOW'S QUICK RETREAT -- CBS has canceled its new television show ''Smith,'' even though the first three episodes attracted an average audience of more than 9 million. The move points out how television, like the movie industry, has become a business where there is little room for a modest success. [C1.] NEW ROLE FOR TONY HAWK -- Rolling Stone is joining forces with two of its advertisers, Activision and Jeep, in a promotional program centered on Mr. Hawk, the skateboarding star. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C10.] AOL SEEKS EUROPEAN EXPANSION -- AOL attracted 31 million unique visitors to its European Web sites last month while Google sites drew more than 160 million. Jonathan F. Miller, chief executive of AOL, wants to start closing that gap as the company tries to transform itself from a business supported largely by subscriber fees to one financed primarily by advertising. [C4.] ROSE AND WAL-MART CHIEF -- Just two months after Charlie Rose, left, scored an interview with H. Lee Scott Jr., the camera-shy chief executive of Wal-Mart, Mr. Rose is honoring Mr. Scott at a private dinner party for his work on behalf of the environment. The close timing of interview and the dinner has raised the eyebrows of Mike Getler, the ombudsman at PBS, which distributes Mr. Rose's talk show. ''Don't do this,'' was Mr. Getler's unsolicited advice to Mr. Rose.
