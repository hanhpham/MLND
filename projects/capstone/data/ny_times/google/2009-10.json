I felt relaxed and calm. Earlier that day I had attended a yoga workshop with a guru from India, then completed a writing assignment for a health and spirituality magazine about, as it happened, instinct - or antar-j\u00f1ana, inner knowledge. I opened the outer door to my vestibule, then crossed through its inner door and into my lobby, leaving my back to the entrance. I got a prickly feeling, I don't know why. I turned. There I saw, pushing open the inner door, an ink-black, gloved hand, exaggeratedly large, controlled and deliberate. It charged toward me. It was trailed by a body, the picture of death.It is difficult for me to render the horror of the image of that man entering my building lobby that night, so great is the disparity between its emotional charge for me now and the stereotypical, almost comical picture he presented. He was a figment from a nightmare. I guessed his height and weight at 6'3\" and 230 pounds, with the physicality of a boxer. The cops later told me that was right. His clothes were dark and innocuous - clean black jeans, black sneakers, a midnight-blue hoodie - as if chosen to leave no impression whatsoever. In contrast, on his face was a neoprene thermal ski mask, the type that tents in front to create a ridge and thus evokes to most anyone who's heard of him Darth Vader. I later discovered while searching on Google that this type of mask is favored by shoppers also enamored of vigilante-style military clothing and toy AK-47s - in other words it is meant to provoke a reaction. Of the figure's actual face I saw only slit-shaped, yellowed eyes and a broad, acned, coal-black forehead.", "headline": {"main": "The Art of Defying Death", "kicker": "Opinionator"}, "pub_date":
